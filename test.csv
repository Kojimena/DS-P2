Having one problem in a tragedy helps the audience focus on that one problem, and having to many of those can cause the audience to get side tracked easily or get lost on what is happening. A second element that aristotle thinks is important is that the story line should have the actor go from good to bad, and not bad to good. This can help the audience stay involved and not get bored through the story, and it also gives the audience to think aboutor be curious about while they are reading it. The third ans last strategy that Aristotle brings up is that ""It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frality, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse.""

After pharaohs died, huge stone pyramids were built as their tombs. Pharaohs were buried in chambers within the pyramids.

d5841f58a9a2,39c16e,"    According to Aristotle, an ideal tragedy should be developed a certain way. He mentions that the play should be complex and full of different ""characters"" and plots, instead of being simple and straight-forward. The tragedy shoud evoke a sense of pity as well as fear onto the audience over a character who does not move from prosperity to adversity (it is just shocking, not pitiful or fearful) or a character that does not face misfortune when they do not deserve it. Additonally, the swap of fortune should be from good to bad rather than bad to good, resulting in an unhappy ending. This, according to Aristotle, hightens the dramatic reaction to the tragedy. Lastly, Aristotle claims the perfect tragedy should be proper instead of comedic, should have conflict such as relationship changes and characters who are slain, and it should have plot in which is ""double-threaded"". In simpler terms, Aristotle believes the ideal tragedy is complex, has a change in plot from good to bad, and should make the audience feel pity and fear towards the actions against the main character.",1.95852822975316,2.22232010034986,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

46bdbaace78f,ebad26,"With the help of Sinclar and Jonas, the shameful conditions that once occurred in Chicago's meatpacking industry had been caught. Specifically, Sinclar reveals the immoral actions that transpired in an attempt to cover up spoiled meat.  Sinclar indicates that the factories covered up spoiled meat through masking odors, reusing rejected meat, and combining normal meat and rat meat simply out of pure laziness. For example, Sinclar states that the meat ""would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption."" That quote in itself explains one of the many attempts in which the factories hid their corrupt techniques. Additionally, Sinclar incorporates vivid and descriptive imagery to illustrate the masked meatpacking process. Sinclar states, ""There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms, and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it. It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats."" The explanation regarding the rats and the leaky rooms emphasizes the feeble conditions located in the specific offices. Another way in which the factory workers hid their spoiled meat was by supplementing odorous pickles to the most spoiled portions of meat. This was done in an attempt to mask the stench of the meat. Overall, Sinclar uses tone and imagery to illustrate the corrupt business done by meatpacking workers.

c028243a852d,39c16e,"According to Aristotle, there are three main elements to create an ideal tragedy within any story. The first main element for a tragedy to be ideal is for it to follow a complex plan and/or plot. The twists and turns of the storyline should not be easily predicted by the readers. Furthermore, the narrative the writer is trying to tell his audience should always end in leaving the readers and the character(s) unhappy. In relation to this element, the second main ingredient to create an ideal tragedy is to incite emotion from the readers, more specifically, pity and fear. Aristotle believes that the readers should not only see the pity and fear that the character is going through, but they should also feel it in an intense manner. Lastly, the third main element to creating an ideal tragedy according to Aristotle is to have a relatable and good character make a reasonable mistake. What Aristotle means from this is to have a character of goodness be brought down by a mistake that anyone could have made but is created to be blown out of proportion. An ""error of judgment or frailty,"" to be exact. This element is important because it creates further pity and fear for the readers to feel towards the character. Making the tragedy of the story much greater. ",3.14408917678279,3.42613276459037,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

6cb46e75e44d,3b9047,"     Ancient Egyptian social structure can be visualized as a pyramid, at the apex of which is Gods and Pharaohs. It was believed that Gods and Goddesses like Ra, Osiris, and Isis controlled the universe at their whim. Pharaohs were believed to be living Gods in human form and given great power and responsibility. Assisting the Pharaoh was the vizier, or tax collector who used scribes, or high-level, literate record keepers. Below the Pharaohs were Nobles and Priests. Nobles held government posts and profited off of tributes to the Pharaoh while Priests held responsibility to please the Gods. One tier lower are Soldiers and Skilled Workers, or Artisans. Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings, also supervising slaves, peasants, and farmers in peacetime. Artisans such as physicians and craftsmen were middle-class people, Craftsmen making and selling jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things. To stimulate the economy, there were merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public. At the bottom of the proverbial barrel are Slaves and Farmers. Slaves were captured Prisoners of War, forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the whim of the pharaoh and nobles. Farmers tended fields, raised animals, kept waterways in good order, worked in the quarries, and built royal monuments. Farmers paid as much as 60% of their yearly harvest as tax.

Aristotle also writes ""...a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about...by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned..."" This proves that Aristotle believes that the main character of a great tragedy must be a man who is neither good nor evil, but somewhere in between; and that that man must be prosperous or renowned. Finally, Aristotle states ""...pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves."" Therefore, if a tragedy were to display a man such as one described above, and have a random, unforeseen misfortune befall him, the audiences would easily be able to relate. In the world, no one knows what fate has in store, and this specific setting easily allows audience members to imagine themselves as the main character.

9acd09053205,3b9047,"No single person could manage all these duties without assistance. The pharaoh appointed a chief minister called a vizier as a supervisor. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected. Working with the vizier were scribes who kept government records. These high-level employees had mastered a rare skill in ancient Egypt — they could read and write. Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods. Nobles enjoyed great status and also grew wealthy from donations to the gods. All Egyptians—from pharaohs to farmers—gave gifts to the gods.Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings. During long periods of peace, soldiers also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces. Skilled workers such as physicians and craftsmen/women made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things. Naturally, there were people needed to buy goods from artisans and traders. These were the merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public.At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers. Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles. Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest—that’s a lot of hay! Social mobility was not impossible. A small number of peasants and farmers moved up the economic ladder. Families saved money to send their sons to village schools to learn trades. These schools were run by priests or by artisans. Boys who learned to read and write could become scribes, then go on to gain employment in the government. It was possible for a boy born on a farm to work his way up into the higher ranks of the government.

In the passage it states, ""...old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white – it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.""

88bb90ee084e,39c16e,"One element of an ideal tragedy as described by Aristotle is that the tragic hero should be somewhere in between a great person and a horrible person whose downfall is a result of an error in judgement. This will be effective in creating feelings of pity and fear for the reader which are two important moods that should result from a tragedy. Another element of an ideal tragedy that Aristotle described is that the tragic hero should be someone well-known and successful. Aristotle uses the examples of Oedipus and Thyestes because both are of royal descent, helping to once again get across the feeling of fear by showing the reader that someone so fortunate may not always be so lucky. Finally, a feature that Aristotle mentioned that should be included in order to create an ideal tragedy would be that the character’s fortune should go from good to bad as opposed to it going from bad to good. This reverse in fortune would create a feeling of pity for the character as the reader would feel sorry for them as they face their downfall.

According to the text, ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation... it possesses no single tragic quality; it neither satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear."" (Paragraph 2) As shown, the elements that make up the tragedy must contain moments of ""pity and fear"", to be recognized as a true tragedy. Also, the tragedy should arise from a mistake or error from the main character. The tragedy should, ""come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse."" (Paragraph 3) Lastly, the ideal tragedy shifts the mood from good to bad, most often ending the same way. The text says, ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad... this principle in his plays, many of which end unhappily.

06bc6445b630,39c16e,"A true tragedy features many elements of misfortune and few of good luck. In this passage,  Aristotle outlines the faults in some so called ""tragedies,"" and what caused others to succeed. The entire point of tragedy is to invoke a deep and true feeling of pity or sadness in the reader, something they can relate to on some level. a man going from rich to poor does not invoke these feelings, and neither does a man going from rags to riches. Villians falling and heroes rising cause opposite emotions than what is to be striven for in a tragedy, so a true tragedy has to have a merely ok character, usually with a moral compass that is skewed. As the focus on this one mediocre man, they shouldn't be taken on tangents that stray from the one main topic of the story of this man. A tragedy written to please the readers like The Odyssey, oftentimes more resembles the plot of a comedy than a tragedy. We have been able to infer from this article that a good tragedy follows at least 3 very important elements, 1) it follows the story of a neither good nor evil man, 2) it has many events of sadness and none of success 3) it follows one main plotline that wouldn't be easily confused with that of another genre.

4aac0bb1600f,3b9047,"Ancient Egypt's system of government is different from what ours is like today. At the top of Egypt's system of government, is the gods. The gods were at the top because the Egyptians believed that the gods controlled the world. In the text it states, ""Egyptians believed that the gods controlled the universe."" The quote from the text shows that the gods were in charge. Next, on the system of government was the pharoahs. The pharaohs had lots of power. The text says, ""Their leaders, called pharaohs, were believed to be gods in human form. They had absolute power over their subjects."" The quote shows that the pharoahs had a lot of controll. The pharaohs also directed the army in case of a conflict. According to the text, ""The pharaoh directed the army in case of a foreign threat or an internal conflict. "" The quote shows they had power. Then, below the pharoahs were the nobles and the priests.  The nobles held government posts, and the priests were responsible for pleasing gods. In the text it says, ""Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods."" Next, were the vizers. The vizers ensured that all taxes were collected. The text says, ""The pharaoh appointed a chief minister called a vizier as a supervisor. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected."" The quote above shows that the vizers had to make sure everyone paid their taxes.Also, the scribes worked with the vizers. The scribes kept government records. They could also read and write. In the text is says, ""Working with the vizier were scribes who kept government records. These high-level employees had mastered a rare skill in ancient Egypt — they could read and write."" This shows that they had an important skill and job. At the bottom of the structure were slaves and farmers. Slaves were forced to work on building projects. The slaves had to do hard labor. The farmers worked on the fields, raised aimals, kept canals and reservoirs in good shape, and much more. To prove that, the text states, ""Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles. Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments."" Farmers also paid taxes that could take away as much as 60% of their yearly-harvest.  As one can see, all people in ancient Egypt had  job, and that ancient Egypt's social structure is different from today. One can also see how different levels of social classes had different power. Egypt's system of government played a important role in ancient Egypt.

91368bc293b4,ebad26,"Upton Sinclair strengthens his argument that conditions were unsanitary in meat processing factories through describing the various ways in which workers would use or cover up spoiled meat. This included suppressing the odor through the use of borax and glycerin, adding more meat to cover the spoiled meat, filling hams with pickle, chopping spoiled meat to make ""sausage"", selling bad hams as ""Number Three Grade"", and through extracting the bone of bad ham and selling it as boneless ham. Since spoiled meat had a very strong odor to it, workers within factories had to ensure that consumers would not be able to smell it so that they would be more likely to buy and consume it. As a result, they used sweet smelling or odorless products in order to mask the stench. Hams were pickled with a machine that was both quick and effective, but would sometimes spoil the meat further. This detail further helped to support Sinclair's claim that factories mainly cared about making a profit rather than the health of their consumers. Additionally, factory workers used methods of hiding or covering up spoiled meat by making it more subtle through covering it with unspoiled meat or chopping it into smaller pieaces so it would go unnoticed by consumers. Lastly, Sinclair describes how spoiled ham was especially covered up through selling bad ham as ""Number Three Grade"" or ""smoked ham"". Later however, ""they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron"" (Sinclair 1906). This would eliminate the title of ""Number Three Grade"" in favor of ""boneless ham"".",3.14408917678279,3.42613276459037,Summarize the various ways the factory would use or cover up spoiled meat.

66db2c282419,39c16e," Three elements of an ideal tragedy that are described by Aristotle are plot, character, and diction. Plot should give a single issue and not double and should be from good to bad in terms of change of fortune. The fortune should come as a result of error in a character from better to worse and imitate pity and fear. Character should be defiant of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity from the spirit of Tragedy and possess no tragic qualities and related to the audience to create emotions. Diction or choice of words should be arranged in a simple, but complex plan and imitate actions of pity and fear, while also thoroughly satisifing moral sense and well-being. Evidence to support these statements are in paragraphs 2 and 3 where it reads, "" A plot of this kind would, doubtless, satisfy the moral sense, but it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves...A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse... the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty...A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity."" These pieces of evidence further support my assertion of the three main elements of an ideal tragedy being plot, character, and diction by showing the importance of a plot and its significance of portraying pity and fear and character and its importance of showing one's personality to be from adversity to prosperity, while showing the significance of diction and its well-being of providing a sense of pity and fear and satisying moral sense throughout the play and tragedy in its choice of words.",1.98471716382454,2.54906922938127,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

04e1f16bf7ad,3b9047,"The system of ancient Egyptian government is like a pyramid. The very top of the pyramid was the gods and the pharaohs because the gods controlled the universe and because the pharaohs were believed to be able to comunicate with the gods so they were thought as god like. The gods controlled the universe and the pharaohs controlled everyone. The priest and nobles were next. Only nobles could hold government office. The priest were supposed to make the gods happy. After nobles and priest came the soldiers. The soldiers were the ones that fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings. Soldiers were also the ones who supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces. The people who were next after soilders were scribes. A scribe recorded in writing the everyday life and extraordinary happenings in ancient Egypt. Their jobs were varied and included writing letters for fellow villagers who couldn't write, recording the amount of crops harvested. After the scribes came the merchants. Egyptian merchants carried products such as gold, papyrus made into writing paper or twisted into rope, linen cloth, and jewelry to other countries. Next after merchants were artisans. Artisans created the fine artwork that often covered temples, royal tombs, and other monuments. They worked in large groups to complete engravings, paintings, and hieroglyphics. Despite artisans' skill and creativity, the upper classes often viewed them as little more than common laborers. Next after artisans were farmers. Now we're on to the lower part of the pyrimad with farmers. Farmers are the ones who harvest food. They also harvest papyrus for others(most likely scribes) to write on. Now we're on the VERY bottom of the social pyrimad with slaves and servants. The servants worked as cooks, butlers, litter carriers, and as pharaoh's dressers. The male servants also worked on royal building projects or were sent to fight in the Egyptian army. Egyptian servants did not have many rights but were usually not treated poorly. Egyptian servants could not own or inherit land. Slaves were very important in ancient Egypt as a big part of the labor force, but they were also used for many other purposes. Many slaves were house servants, gardeners, farm labor, musicians and dancers of excellent talent, scribes, and accountants.",3.80272207089915,3.51483103434524,"In complete sentences, summarize the structure of the ancient Egyptian system of government.

He tried to answer this question by getting rid of democracy due to the point that he believed that democracy was the main weakness and that it favors individual over the whole community. As democracy was expelled from the classroom Ron Jones was seem to become more of an authoritarian figure in the classroom as he told the rules and continue to make a very strict résumé for students to be as disciplined as possible. The main concern in this experiment was when he made a slew resembling that of the Nazi regime where students would have to salute to each other even when they were outside his classroom. As the movement gained popularity the new motivated students became a sort of court not letting any nonmembers into the classroom and eventually got over 200 participants. The main reasoning for terminating the movement was because students became too invested into the experiment and Jones felt it was slipping out of his control to get rid of the experiment he lied to the students by announcing that the third wave was a part of a national wave movement and Jones ordered students to attend a publicly announced presidential candidate of the movement, when the day came they were presented with a blank channel and Jones saw that as an opportunity to announce that they were a part of an experiment to demonstrate how people willingly create a sense of superiority over others even when horrible things are happening.",3.10899544501482,1.49539674836705,Summarize how the Third Wave developed over such a short period of time and why the experiment was ended.,The Third Wave,"Background

This is because he thinks the downfall of a viruous man would simply shock the audience, while the downfall of a villain would satisfy the morals of the audience, but not cause them to feel pity or fear. The last element is that the main character's turn of fate shouldn't be brought about by immoral behavior, but instead by a great error or frailty.

Cut up by the two-thousand-revolutions- a-minute flyers, and mixed with half a ton of other meat, no odor that ever was in a ham could make any difference"".

e18f9d574064,ebad26,"To start off, the factory would use or cover up meat by injecting chemicals into the ham to take away the odor and to either skin the animal or chop out the bones, especially the bad meat surrounded by a particular bone. Plus using machines made the meat more plump and juicy.  Also they would even cook up tiny bits of skin as head of cheese. California hams were the meat that took up the animal's shoulder which were real tough. The text says, ""rub soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters.  ""Boneless hams,” which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed; and “California hams,” which were the shoulders and big knuckle joints.

The machines consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; this needle plunged  into meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds."" This demonstrates the idea of how all employees within a factory process the meat by using these different working methods. To summarize, a few ways that helped the factory to make it more efficent was by covering up the ghastly smell, using machinery to help workers, and taking out the bad meat from the inside. Of course, there are a couple of other systems like combining other meat together to make sausages.

0ea3f8f89bc0,39c16e,"According to Aristotle, an ideal tragedy consists of a variety of elements: plot, character, action, diction, thought, spectacle, and song (music), however, the first three are most significant. Aristotle's main points help readers to understand tragedies, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse.""  In contrast, character displays men's qualities, ""the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families."" The purpose of action in the tragedy, is not the representation of character. Without action there cannot be a tragedy, however, there may be one without character, "" It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation.""",2.33282549895162,1.62922087717298,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

17b6ecc31810,39c16e,"According to Aristotle, a good tragedy should include different elements, three of which include: the ability to evoke emotions such as pity and fear, a well constructed and thought out plot that does not ""double as some maintain"", and a character's situation that shifts from good to bad. Pity and fear can be drawn out of a viewer or reader when the characters do something to bring unfortunate circumstances upon themselves. For example, Romeo and Juliet create a situation in which they both end up killing themselves over the death of the other. In Greek tragedies, the characters must live with their mistakes and suffer, while in Shakespearian tragedies, the characters die. These two are similar because each person has misfortune brought upon them by their own misjudgment. This ties directly to how the character's situation turns from good to bad, rather than from bad to good. The plot must also be complex, well-constructed, and ""be single in its issue"".",2.01816844746937,2.55760895955939,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

The second element of a good tragety would the progress from good to bad fortune throughout the story.  A tragety isn't a tragety if the protagonist has a happy ending because it just isn't tragic. In order for the story to be tragic there needs to be a great amount of misery and woe involving the protagonist having the good things in life take from them throughout the span of the story. The third element of a good tragety is an unhappy ending. If the story ends happily for the protagonist then the story is not at all sad or tragic. We as people prefer to have a story end happily for the protagonist because it sits with us better. We prefer to walk away knowing that the main character got what they always wanted and that they found joy in the end.

dfb33bc8ee43,39c16e,"Aristotle stated that the ideal tragedy needs to imitate human action in order to make the audience have pity or fear for a character. In order for this to happen, the tragedy must avoid certain roads that  can be considered predictable. An example of this would be a good person facing challenges or a bad person becoming prosperous. Another example would be making the downfall of the villain a big event that has no consequences. All three of this things, mainly due to their predictability, make it difficult for a viewer to invest their emotions into the tragedy. A good tragedy is also defined by a good character encountering evil, rather than a bad person growing and becoming better. Calling a play a tragedy certainly does not imply that a character will grow and become better.
