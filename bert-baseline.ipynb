Also they each had to pay the pharos taxes. ( From farmers) Priets were Also responsible for pleasing the gods and Pharos. These are reasons how government and how different social classes in government were involved during it.\",\n"," 'The structure of the ancient egyptian system of government was based highly on your status. It was similar to a pyramid. The lowest being slaves,peasants, and farmers. Once at the bottom it was very hard to get higher unless you worked extremely hard or many young boys whose parents saved money to send them to learn trades. The middle of the pyramid consisted of soldiers who looked over farmers and other in the lowers social class. Powerful nobles and priests were also in this section of pyramid. Above this scale was the highest that consists of the Pharoh and other royalty. Pharohas were often looked at as Gods because they looked to the Gods for everything it made sense that their ruler must be one as well.Pharohs were put in actual pyramids and tombs made espically for them because of their high status. Pharohs had assistance such as the vizer who was another of the many people who looked after things for them.

He conducted this experiment because he was unable to explain to his students how people throughout history followed the crowed when terrible things were happening. He developed the experiment by enforcing strict classroom disipline. Some of the rules were the students had to stand up to ask or answer questions and they had to do it in three words or fewer, and were required to begin each remark with \"Mr. Jones\". On the fourth day of the experiment Mr. Jones had to end the experiment because he felt that it was slipping out of control.

Formerly these had been sold as “Number Three Grade,” but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron.\", \"The packers were always originating such schemes—they had what they called “boneless hams,” which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and “California hams,” which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out; and fancy “skinned hams,” which were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no one would buy them—that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled “head cheese!”, \"moldy and white – it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.\")',\n"," 'The Egyptian government is in some ways like how it is today. the pharaohs being the presidents, the nobles/priests being the vice presidents (paragraph 6), the scribes/viziers being the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the farmers/slaves being citizens/prisoners (paragraph 5). The soldiers were treated with the same respect they are today.  People\\'s social class was determined by their job. Most craftsmen and artisans were considered the middle class, but the farmers/slaves were seen as the lower class (paragraph 11). In Egyptian fashion, the social classes were put into a pyramid-shaped structure. (upper class, middle class, lower class.) The lower class would \"build the pyramids\" for the upper class. The upper class was seen as wealthy, whilst the middle class was seen as the people with jobs like craftsmen and artisans.',\n"," 'The Third Wave developed over a short period of time since Jones referred to it as a symbol of strength and used the the motto, “Strength through discipline, strength through community, strength through action, strength through pride.” He also had the students use the salute he used outside of class which caused more students to join. The expiriment was ended because Jones felt that the expiriment was slipping out of control.',\n"," '    The Gods where at the top, being the rulers of the earth. My example is paragraph 1 \"At the top were gods, such as Ra, Osiris, and Isis.\". The second were what egyptians beleived to be human gods, Pharoahs.

If your parents were farmers you would have to keep the business going but if you were royalty or something you would have the best life ever.\",\n"," 'different social classes were involved in this government because the different classes were higher than the others so the government made them in different tiers for social structure.',\n"," 'The Egyptian system of government was more complicated than it seemed. Different social classes meant different statuses in their government.

Under the Nobles and Priests, in the middle, are the Soldiers. They fought and ended wars, and they supervised anyone lower than them. Finally, at the bottom, are the farmers and slaves.

The students quickly picked it up and were enthusiastic: possibly in part by the slogan “Strength through discipline, strength through community, strength through action, strength through pride,” which would make one think they can become stronger than before. Mr. Jones noticed and realised that the experiment had gone farther than intended. He gathered the students in the room, students who expected to see a presidential canidate of the movement announce the Third Wave's existence on television, and explained to them that this was an experiment to test herd decisions.\",\n"," 'They rubbed the meet with chemilcals and tons of othe meats to cover up the smell and then put it into sausage so no one would ever tell.',\n"," 'The first element is someone who will cause their own fall, who is neither bad or good.

First, he believes that an ideal tragedy should have events that evoke pity or fear for the protagonist.

Second, Aristotle claims that a good tragedy should have a suitable plot that is not too complicated and in which the fortune turns from good to bad because of the characters\\' actions. He establishes this in the third paragraph: \"A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse. \" Finally, Aristotle highlights that the play should not be written based on what the audience wants- \"It is accounted the best because of the weakness of the spectators; for the poet is guided in what he writes by the wishes of his audience. The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure\".
