1ec6c7f88443,39c16e,"           Aristotle believes there are certain elements that come together to produce an ideal tragedy. He believes the character who commits the tragic flaw should be a fair character who is well known, and should be not a great nor terrible person. For example, in Romeo and Juliet, Romeo isn't a villian or an amazing person, but rather a typical teenage boy more than anything else.  In addition, Aristotle believes the tragic flaw should not occur due to immoral behavior by the character, but rather by an error or a mistake. For example, Romeo's tragic flaw came through his impulsive decision to marry Juliet, which wasn't a terrible, immoral act. Lastly, the plot of a tragedy should consist of a good to bad change of fortune. In the beginning of the tragedy, the character should experience something good, but his/her's fortune should turn to something bad towards the end. Overall, the ideas of a neither good nor bad character, an underserving misfortune, and a flow of a good to bad fortune are three of Aristotle's many elements of an ideal tragedy.

574369ff8f20,39c16e,"An ideal tragedy must have a relateable hero, a singular plot, and a plot where the hero's own human flaws cause their demise. This is exemplified by Aristotle's description of the ideal tragic hero. Paragraph 2 states, ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families."" It's imperative to understand that the protagonist of a Greek tragedy and their qualities are some of the defining traits of a tragedy. The protagonist has to speak to a common humanity within the audience in order to have maximum emotional appeal and impact.  The audience will only be distressed at the events the hero is subject to if they can cry with him and relate  to them just like any person. If the protagonist is either someone incredibly saint-like that never makes mistakes that result in conflict or outrageously and comedically evil that succeeds because of their malevolence, the audience will not be able to see themselves in the hero because such drastic personalities or situations rarely happen in real life. Because the fundamental plot elements seem fantastical, the audiene will feel more removed from the play and will not feel the pain as the hero feels it when they fail, or the triumphance when they succeed. The best way to make a hero human to the audience is to give them nuance. Like most people, the tragic hero should generally strive to do good but get caught up by their own mistakes like pride, anger, lack of judgement, etc. so that they aren't bad people but still accountable for their mistakes. It's essential to make tragic heroes essentially common men that the audience already identifies with (such as honorable nobility who are still humans without any special or divine powers) who have relateable motivations and qualities that cause them to fail due to their own actions while still being sympathetic people. Since this reminds the audience of themselves, it will feel all the more tragic when they suffer, which is the point of the tragic play. In order to have the optimal amount of misery, the plot should be singular. This is discussed in paragraphs 3 and 4, which state, ""He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families. ...In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. Like the Odyssey, it has a double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the good and for the bad. ...It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies — like Orestes and Aegisthus — quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain."" This text demonstrates how one single serious plot is necessary for a proper tragic play. A true tragedy must have the complex protagonist endure general failure as well as the associated physical and emotional pain due to their own incorrect actions, and this should be the only plot point in the play to prevent distractions. On the other hand, double plots  often resolve positively without events like major character death or conflict. The idea that the protagonist does not have to endure any of the consequences of their actions and suffer as a result is the complete antithesis of a tragedy. As a result, the audience does not reach catharsis because there are no emotional stakes if everything is fixed by the end. Therefore, they have no lasting negative emotions pertaining to the play.",3.36999122260667,3.89794064266612,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

88bb90ee084e,39c16e,"One element of an ideal tragedy as described by Aristotle is that the tragic hero should be somewhere in between a great person and a horrible person whose downfall is a result of an error in judgement. This will be effective in creating feelings of pity and fear for the reader which are two important moods that should result from a tragedy. Another element of an ideal tragedy that Aristotle described is that the tragic hero should be someone well-known and successful. Aristotle uses the examples of Oedipus and Thyestes because both are of royal descent, helping to once again get across the feeling of fear by showing the reader that someone so fortunate may not always be so lucky. Finally, a feature that Aristotle mentioned that should be included in order to create an ideal tragedy would be that the character’s fortune should go from good to bad as opposed to it going from bad to good. This reverse in fortune would create a feeling of pity for the character as the reader would feel sorry for them as they face their downfall.

91368bc293b4,ebad26,"Upton Sinclair strengthens his argument that conditions were unsanitary in meat processing factories through describing the various ways in which workers would use or cover up spoiled meat. This included suppressing the odor through the use of borax and glycerin, adding more meat to cover the spoiled meat, filling hams with pickle, chopping spoiled meat to make ""sausage"", selling bad hams as ""Number Three Grade"", and through extracting the bone of bad ham and selling it as boneless ham. Since spoiled meat had a very strong odor to it, workers within factories had to ensure that consumers would not be able to smell it so that they would be more likely to buy and consume it. As a result, they used sweet smelling or odorless products in order to mask the stench. Hams were pickled with a machine that was both quick and effective, but would sometimes spoil the meat further. This detail further helped to support Sinclair's claim that factories mainly cared about making a profit rather than the health of their consumers. Additionally, factory workers used methods of hiding or covering up spoiled meat by making it more subtle through covering it with unspoiled meat or chopping it into smaller pieaces so it would go unnoticed by consumers. Lastly, Sinclair describes how spoiled ham was especially covered up through selling bad ham as ""Number Three Grade"" or ""smoked ham"". Later however, ""they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron"" (Sinclair 1906). This would eliminate the title of ""Number Three Grade"" in favor of ""boneless ham"".",3.14408917678279,3.42613276459037,Summarize the various ways the factory would use or cover up spoiled meat.

In the chapter from Poetics, Aristotle states, ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged... on the complex plan"" (Paragrapgh 2). When Aristole says this, he means that there should be actions that entertain pity, fear, and bring in the ""tragic"" part of the writing. There has to be a bundle of emotions to make the audience feel a certain way for the character. In the chapter from Poetics, Aristotle also states, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issure, rather than double as some maintain"" (Paragraph 3). This means that there should be a plot that goes from good to bad. This provides an emotional connection to the character with their successes, but as the ""bad"" part comes in, you wil feel for the character. In the chapter from Poetics,  Aristotle states, ""It is accounted the best because of the weakness of the speactator; for the poet is guided in what he writes by the wishes of his audience"" (Paragraph 4). If you write the ending in the audiences wishes, they will be more intrigued. It's in the best wishes that the poet ends the writing in the audiences wishes, it will result in pleasure.

c028243a852d,39c16e,"According to Aristotle, there are three main elements to create an ideal tragedy within any story. The first main element for a tragedy to be ideal is for it to follow a complex plan and/or plot. The twists and turns of the storyline should not be easily predicted by the readers. Furthermore, the narrative the writer is trying to tell his audience should always end in leaving the readers and the character(s) unhappy. In relation to this element, the second main ingredient to create an ideal tragedy is to incite emotion from the readers, more specifically, pity and fear. Aristotle believes that the readers should not only see the pity and fear that the character is going through, but they should also feel it in an intense manner. Lastly, the third main element to creating an ideal tragedy according to Aristotle is to have a relatable and good character make a reasonable mistake. What Aristotle means from this is to have a character of goodness be brought down by a mistake that anyone could have made but is created to be blown out of proportion. An ""error of judgment or frailty,"" to be exact. This element is important because it creates further pity and fear for the readers to feel towards the character.

8c39908257e3,ebad26,"There were various ways that factories would use or cover up spoiled meat. The employees played a huge role in why meat was processed under harsh conditions. Workers lacked washing their hands, and the water that men washed their hands in was also ladled into sausages. Meat would be tumbled out on the floor in dust and dirt. Meat would fall onto surfaces where employees have spit thousand of times. As a result of this, meats were extremely treacherous. According to the text, it states, ""There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs."" The meat was also in a space where rats were present, causing rats to run across the meats. As a result of rats running around, they poison them. After poisoning the rats, the rats would go in the hopper with the meat while they are processing. Workers call the poisoned rat a tidbit, and they did not care to remove the rat from the meat. This was extremely unsanitary and cruel. According to the text, it states, ""There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms, and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it."" Workers were also capable of changing the meat into; however, they wanted them, such as turning the meat brown or making the meat ""unspoil."" They would use chemistry and machines to change spoiled meat. If it were so difficult to get these meats to change, they would sell it as a number three grade meat. According to the text, it states, ""Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be found some that had gone to the bad. Formerly these had been sold as ""Number Three Grade,"" but later on, some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron.""

26e11646cf98,39c16e,"Aristotle describes many elements that should be included in a tragedy in On Tragedy. First, he believes that an ideal tragedy should have events that evoke pity or fear for the protagonist. He states this in paragraph two: ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" He goes on to explain how the audience will feel pity or fear- by portraying a protagonist who is not particularly good or evil, just an ordinary person who falls into misfortune. Second, Aristotle claims that a good tragedy should have a suitable plot that is not too complicated and in which the fortune turns from good to bad because of the characters' actions. He establishes this in the third paragraph: ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse. "" Finally, Aristotle highlights that the play should not be written based on what the audience wants- ""It is accounted the best because of the weakness of the spectators; for the poet is guided in what he writes by the wishes of his audience. The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure"".

d5a135e55d4d,3b9047,"The base starts with farmers and slaves. The economical positions rise as they go up. At the very top point of the pyramid are the gods. Here is the order from greatest to least: Egyptian Gods/Pharaohs,  nobles/priests, soldiers, craftmen/traders, and lastly farmers/slaves. The gods are at the highest position in status. They have the right to overpower everyone. Also, since everyone praises them they believe that the gods were responsible of many things as well. Like safety. Sometimes the pharaohs direct the army or create laws. As stated in the text, ""They had absolute power over their subjects...The pharaoh directed the army in case of a foreign threat or an internal conflict. All the laws were enacted at the discretion of the pharaoh."" Because the pharaohs/gods couldn't do all the duties themselves they have assistants called viziers which are chief ministers. They have the duty of collecting taxes from people like farmers. According to the article, ""No single person could manage all these duties without assistance. The pharaoh appointed a chief minister called a vizier as a supervisor. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected."" Called a ""chain of command"" the viziers have assistants as well.  They are called scribes; they are the only ones who can read and write. Now under the whole chain of gods/pharaohs there are the nobles/priests. According to the text, the only people who can develop government posts are the nobles. And priests' duties are to keep the gods satisfied. Like said in the text, ""Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods."" Also, the nobles grow very wealthy from recieving all the gifts of the gods from the subjects. Next are the soldiers. The soldiers fight in wars or end ""domestic uprisings."" Also, they sometimes keep an eye on farmers, peasants, and slaves. As said in the article, ""Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings. During long periods of peace, soldiers also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces."" Next comes the middle class which is made up of skilled people life artisans, craftmen/women, and physicians. The craftmen would create jewlery and other products and then sell them to make some money. They were known as the merchants and sorekeepers. ""Skilled workers such as physicians and craftsmen/women made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things. Naturally, there were people needed to buy goods from artisans and traders. These were the merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public."" And at the bottom/base are the farmers and slaves. The farmers has to raise animals, take care of the fields, conduct some tasks in the stone quarries, construct royal monuments, and are responsible to keep the reservoirs and canals in shape. They also have to pay 60% of their annual harvest towards tax. ""Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs  in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest—that’s a lot of hay!""  Although people can't raise their status, young boys can go to school to learn how to read/write and then can become scribes or can apply for employment in the government which would make their status rise. The slaves have to work on developing projects and put extreme effort at the disrection of the nobles or pharaohs. ""At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers.

While the primary character or the hero within these pieces should be an individual which is situated between the two extremes of incredibly just an incredibly evil, they should be neither be the epitome of saintly and good while they should neither have their downfall be brought to them due to their depravity or vice which they possess and should instead occur due to their own frailty or a minute error of judgment or mistake, and they should be an individual which is both prosperous and renowned being well known and plentiful within their lives or be other individuals connected to families which are of this variety.

""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"".  A complex plan of a plot is extremly important in order to have an ideal tradgedy.  The plot must move from the begining to the end according to a cramped sequence of events that are to happen.  Furthermore, another element to an ideal plot is charecter.  ""Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses — on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible"".  A plot should consist of a charceter going from joy to misery as the plot progresses.  A final element in order to form a perfect tradegdy is thought.  A charecter should have a tragic deed or mistake, ususally towards the end, in which his thoughts are shown out loud and leads to the most tragic of poems.",1.69073979171235,1.46105500827547,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

81b4b359e045,39c16e,"  According to Aristotle, there are many components that make an ideal tragedy. First off, a perfect tragedy never follows a simple plan -- and should follow a complex sequence of events -- though it must maintain a transition from good to bad. Furthermore, a tragedy should incite feelings of pity and fear, and these feelings should be incited without cliche. Lastly, there should never be a downfall of a villian -- and instead the downfall of a well-regarded person and must be on the account of wrong judgement or fraility.",1.54223178910393,1.37036763462013,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

(3) Sinclair explains that these factories are willing to risk the health of many human beings for some more money. Not only are the factories willing to do this but the employees aswell.  Looking at this question of whether or not to use supplies to contaminate meat seems like a very simple answer. However, to the factory workers in the twentieth century, it was not. Not only was it not a simple answer there was no question.  ""There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it ... . It was too dark in these storage places to see well ... There was no place for the men to wash their hands before they ate their dinner"" (4-5) Sinclair goes on to explain that there was not an option for the workers, and the factory owners knew this.  They knew the workers needed the money to provide for their families.  To add to the atmosphere of the factories Sinclair says, ""With one member trimming beef in a cannery, and another working in a sausage factory, the family had a first-hand knowledge"" (1) The people were scared to step up for fear of backlash from their ""family"".

3613c50796bc,39c16e,"Aristotle states that the most important element of an ideal tragedy is that it should excite pity and fear in the audience. He states, ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation""(7-9).  This element really helps to draw in the audience and make them feel the right emotions for the characters. Another element that Aristotle believes to be valid for a tragedy is that the main character should be a normal person, not terribly good nor evil. He describes this as, ""That of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity""(22-23). Having a more normal character makes it easier for the audience to relate to them as well as to feel for them and understand what they are going through. The last element that Aristotle describes is that of a well-constructed plot. He writes, ""The change of fortune should not be from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad""(27).  Structuring the plot in this way truly enforces the feeling and effects of a tragedy. These are just three small elements that the great philosopher, Aristotle, believed to be important in a perfect tragedy.",2.51454508494933,2.84414375349913,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

86ff6adb817e,39c16e,"Three elements of an ideal tragedy include a complex plot, character, and proper structure and construction. The plot itself should not simply tell the series of events that occur in the story. Rather, it should focus on how the story can be presented in a way to evoke emotions from the audience, such as pity and fear. The characters in a tragedy should also not start from a spot of despair and work towards success. While a basic development from fortune to adversity would also not be ideal for a tragedy, adding more complexity to this story and including aspects that encourage fear or pity would contribute to developing an ideal tragedy. The construction of how the characters reach their final downfall is also a significant element of an ideal tragedy. For instance, not only should a character have a level of relatability to them, but they should also meet their downfall in a unfortunate and undeserving manner. Often, the story should be planned out so that the character goes into ruin despite their morals or intentions.

d5841f58a9a2,39c16e,"    According to Aristotle, an ideal tragedy should be developed a certain way. He mentions that the play should be complex and full of different ""characters"" and plots, instead of being simple and straight-forward. The tragedy shoud evoke a sense of pity as well as fear onto the audience over a character who does not move from prosperity to adversity (it is just shocking, not pitiful or fearful) or a character that does not face misfortune when they do not deserve it. Additonally, the swap of fortune should be from good to bad rather than bad to good, resulting in an unhappy ending. This, according to Aristotle, hightens the dramatic reaction to the tragedy. Lastly, Aristotle claims the perfect tragedy should be proper instead of comedic, should have conflict such as relationship changes and characters who are slain, and it should have plot in which is ""double-threaded"". In simpler terms, Aristotle believes the ideal tragedy is complex, has a change in plot from good to bad, and should make the audience feel pity and fear towards the actions against the main character.",1.95852822975316,2.22232010034986,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

6cb46e75e44d,3b9047,"     Ancient Egyptian social structure can be visualized as a pyramid, at the apex of which is Gods and Pharaohs. It was believed that Gods and Goddesses like Ra, Osiris, and Isis controlled the universe at their whim. Pharaohs were believed to be living Gods in human form and given great power and responsibility. Assisting the Pharaoh was the vizier, or tax collector who used scribes, or high-level, literate record keepers. Below the Pharaohs were Nobles and Priests. Nobles held government posts and profited off of tributes to the Pharaoh while Priests held responsibility to please the Gods. One tier lower are Soldiers and Skilled Workers, or Artisans. Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings, also supervising slaves, peasants, and farmers in peacetime. Artisans such as physicians and craftsmen were middle-class people, Craftsmen making and selling jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things. To stimulate the economy, there were merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public. At the bottom of the proverbial barrel are Slaves and Farmers. Slaves were captured Prisoners of War, forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the whim of the pharaoh and nobles. Farmers tended fields, raised animals, kept waterways in good order, worked in the quarries, and built royal monuments. Farmers paid as much as 60% of their yearly harvest as tax.

06bc6445b630,39c16e,"A true tragedy features many elements of misfortune and few of good luck. In this passage,  Aristotle outlines the faults in some so called ""tragedies,"" and what caused others to succeed. The entire point of tragedy is to invoke a deep and true feeling of pity or sadness in the reader, something they can relate to on some level. a man going from rich to poor does not invoke these feelings, and neither does a man going from rags to riches. Villians falling and heroes rising cause opposite emotions than what is to be striven for in a tragedy, so a true tragedy has to have a merely ok character, usually with a moral compass that is skewed. As the focus on this one mediocre man, they shouldn't be taken on tangents that stray from the one main topic of the story of this man. A tragedy written to please the readers like The Odyssey, oftentimes more resembles the plot of a comedy than a tragedy. We have been able to infer from this article that a good tragedy follows at least 3 very important elements, 1) it follows the story of a neither good nor evil man, 2) it has many events of sadness and none of success 3) it follows one main plotline that wouldn't be easily confused with that of another genre.

ee49145aa624,39c16e,"The Greek philosopher Aristotle described an ideal tragedy in literature in many defining aspects.  One of these is that a tragedy is complicated and heightens emotions such as remorse and fright as in the reader as the plot moves along.  Aristotle concludes, ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation.""  Due to this, Aristotle indicates how tragedies should be deeply thought out to provide an emotional experience in a reader.  Furthermore, a second aspect is how the changes throughout the plot will lead to a downfall of a character or event.  He demonstrates that the change should be ""not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad.""  Moreover, a third aspect of a tragedy is that the plot and storyline should follow one strict and sole storyline that will lead to the eventual negative outcome.  Aristotle suggests, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.""  To summarize, 3 elements of a tragedy from Aristotle are strong emotions stirring in a reader, the defeat of a major character or events in the plot, and one plotline that strictly follows the issue of this story until the tragic ending.",2.83495109138843,3.14321133114365,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

This shows one of the key elements to an ideal tragedy and explains how it must relate to a common human experience and scare the common audience because they related to the main character.
