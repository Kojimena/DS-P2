Each class had responsibilities that they owed to the government to fufill, and those responsibilities needed to be fufilled in order to make a functioning society. I know this because in the text that I cited from, the author states multiple scenarios where people of all classes are needed for a functioning government. One of those scenarios that the author states are when soldiers, most commonly part of the middle-class by my guess, go off to war.  Another example that the author says in the text is when farmers, a part of the bottom class, tend their fields, raised their animals, and more. Ancient Egyptians would not be able to live without farmers, because they grew and raised plenty of food. That is why different social classes were involved in the Ancient Egyptian government.',\n"," \"When Ron Jones started this experiement, it was to show the students that even if people knew it was wrong, they always followed the crowd. Meaning that when a leader forces you to follow certain laws or rules and you know it is not okay, you will still follow it because the crowd is. For example, when Adolf Hitler was ruling Germany many of the people didn't protest against the dictator because they were afraid or they were punished. The Nazis had no real idea what was going on, they just followed orders because that is how they were trained. Jones soon realized that students were taking this experiment way farther than he had expected, especially since the class went from 30 to 43 in only three days. by the fourth day the students had shown great loyalty to the project and Jones was getting worried. Jones felt that he was losing control of this experiment and decided to terminate it by lying to the students.

The Upper class was filled up by pharaohs, the Middle class was filled up by priests, nobles, craftsmen, scribes, and merchants, and the Lower class was filled by slaves, and farmers. Now, all of these places were connected to the government. Their government was basically warshiping gods and goddessess. The pharaoh was connected to the government, because he of she was the ruler of Egypt, \"Their leaders, called pharaohs, were blieved to be gods in human form\" (paragraph, 2). The pharaohs were thought of as gods and godessess, they were thought of as walking gods. The Middle class was connected to the government because they either helped the pharaoh directly, or they had sustainable jobs to sell things to people, \"Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tribute paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods... Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings.

The nobles and soldiers held the Middle class, because they weren\\'t as wealthy as the pharaohs, but they had more money than the peasants, farmers, and slaves. The Lower class was connected to the government, because their jobs paid for their homes and food, \"At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers. Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toild at the discretion of the pharaohs or nobles.

Since spoiled meat had a very strong odor to it, workers within factories had to ensure that consumers would not be able to smell it so that they would be more likely to buy and consume it. As a result, they used sweet smelling or odorless products in order to mask the stench. Hams were pickled with a machine that was both quick and effective, but would sometimes spoil the meat further. This detail further helped to support Sinclair\\'s claim that factories mainly cared about making a profit rather than the health of their consumers. Additionally, factory workers used methods of hiding or covering up spoiled meat by making it more subtle through covering it with unspoiled meat or chopping it into smaller pieaces so it would go unnoticed by consumers. Lastly, Sinclair describes how spoiled ham was especially covered up through selling bad ham as \"Number Three Grade\" or \"smoked ham\".

Aristotle believes that the plot should always be provided a beginning, middle, and end, in a proper way.  \"A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.\"(Paragraph. 3) Overall, Aristotle\\'s belief of the concept regarding plot is to be an imitation of an action, a single action. Second, the element of the character for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered as neither good nor bad, as a result, should instead be considered as a surprise to the audience of the character\\'s morals. \"There remains, then, the character between these two extremes.\"(Paragraph 2) Aristotle thinks that if the tragic hero were to be better than one to be good or bad, then the tragedy as a whole would be seen as stronger than before. Third, the element of the thought for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered always on the type of situation being given, whether it is an individual who lives in prosperity or an individual who lives in adversity. \"yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.\"(Paragraph 2) In terms of thought, the thoughts that should be considered is if the kind of unexpected sort of events happens should they belong to the wealthy or the poor, because of someone\\'s poor sense of judgement or by fate.

He went on to describe in detail the horriable unsafe, disgusting, and moraliy wrong prosses that of which the meat was packaged. One thing the industery would do is putting many chemicals into the rotten meat to make it look better so that people would buy it.  As seen in the novel, \"Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell [...] also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose. In the pickling of hams they had an ingenious apparatus, by which they saved time and increased the capacity of the plant—a machine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by plunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds. [...]  Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be found some that had gone to the bad. Formerly these had been sold as “Number Three Grade,” but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron.\"(Sinclair 2).

Such as droping loads of rotten meat into tubs of vinager and leaving it so that it would be more appealing.  In \"The Jungle\" it also states, \"Some of it they would make into \"smoked\" sausage – but as the smoking took time, and was therefore expensive, they would call upon their chemistry department, and preserve it with borax and color it with gelatin to make it brown.\" (Sinclair 5). This qoute shows one of the many dangerous chemicals they would put in the meat, as borax is a cleaning tool. Eatting could lead to death as seen in www.medicalnewstoday.com it states, \"Borax is not safe to ingest. According to the NLM\\'s Toxicology Data Network, borax is easy for the body to break down when either inhaled or swallowed. However, if inhalation or ingestion occurs, both serious poisoning and organ damage can result.\"(Wilson 2019).
