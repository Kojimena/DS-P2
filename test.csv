d377fe983b65,39c16e,"According to Aristotle, 3 elements of an ideal tragedy include being complex, being emotional, and having a character go from good to bad fortune. First, Aristotle explains that ""a perfect tragedy should be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan"". (Aristotle 2). Aristotle continues by suggesting that the tragedy should ""imitate actions which excite pity and fear"" and calls this the ""distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (Aristotle 2). This desire for readers to feel pitiful and fearful leads to Aristotle's second element of an ideal tragedy; for it to be emotional. Aristotle claims that an emotional piece ""is proper rather to Comedy,"" suggesting that all tragedies should end with the reader feeling sorrow. (Aristotle 4). Lastly, the author states that the ideal tragedy ""should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad"" (Aristotle 3). Aristotle believes that the ideal tragedy should include ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgment or frailty"" (Aristotle 3).",2.17293236566335,0.239216658363737,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

32f23f665431,39c16e,"According to this reading, Aristotle views the concept of an ideal tragedy by using elements of six different parts, but the most important according to him, are elements of plot, character, and thought. First, the element of the plot for an ideal strategy is meant to be the soul of the overall tragedy as a whole, and its main responsibility to keep every other factor that is part of a tragedy together. Aristotle believes that the plot should always be provided a beginning, middle, and end, in a proper way.  ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.""(Paragraph. 3) Overall, Aristotle's belief of the concept regarding plot is to be an imitation of an action, a single action. Second, the element of the character for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered as neither good nor bad, as a result, should instead be considered as a surprise to the audience of the character's morals. ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes.""(Paragraph 2) Aristotle thinks that if the tragic hero were to be better than one to be good or bad, then the tragedy as a whole would be seen as stronger than before. Third, the element of the thought for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered always on the type of situation being given, whether it is an individual who lives in prosperity or an individual who lives in adversity. ""yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.""(Paragraph 2) In terms of thought, the thoughts that should be considered is if the kind of unexpected sort of events happens should they belong to the wealthy or the poor, because of someone's poor sense of judgement or by fate.

This means that the story follows the actions and resolution of the main character only, and focuses on the character's change of fortune froom good to bad. Another element most crucial to a tragedy is that the plot must incite both fear and pity for all who watch the play. If the play ends with a ""feel good"" moment, then it has failed as a tragedy, as it doesn't incite fear and pity. The purpose of tragedy is not to  satisfy some moral sense, but to inspire feelings appropriate to witnessing a tragedy, to experience a ""cleansing"" of watching someone else suffer.  Lastly, an ideal tragedy must have a protagonist that is not overly righteous or holy, but is not depraved; the character is somewhat middle of the road.  By having the character behave in this way it makes the story more realistic and true, making the character's journey that much more engaging for the audience.

A second element that aristotle thinks is important is that the story line should have the actor go from good to bad, and not bad to good. This can help the audience stay involved and not get bored through the story, and it also gives the audience to think aboutor be curious about while they are reading it. The third ans last strategy that Aristotle brings up is that ""It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frality, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse.""

c028243a852d,39c16e,"According to Aristotle, there are three main elements to create an ideal tragedy within any story. The first main element for a tragedy to be ideal is for it to follow a complex plan and/or plot. The twists and turns of the storyline should not be easily predicted by the readers. Furthermore, the narrative the writer is trying to tell his audience should always end in leaving the readers and the character(s) unhappy. In relation to this element, the second main ingredient to create an ideal tragedy is to incite emotion from the readers, more specifically, pity and fear. Aristotle believes that the readers should not only see the pity and fear that the character is going through, but they should also feel it in an intense manner. Lastly, the third main element to creating an ideal tragedy according to Aristotle is to have a relatable and good character make a reasonable mistake. What Aristotle means from this is to have a character of goodness be brought down by a mistake that anyone could have made but is created to be blown out of proportion. An ""error of judgment or frailty,"" to be exact. This element is important because it creates further pity and fear for the readers to feel towards the character.

In the pickling of hams they had an ingenious apparatus,
 by which they saved time and increased the capacity
 of the plant—a machine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by plunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds. And yet, in spite of this, there would be hams found spoiled, some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them. To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor—a process known to the workers as “giving them thirty per cent.” Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be found some that had gone to the bad. Formerly these had been sold as “Number Three Grade,” but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron. After this invention there was no longer Number One, Two, and Three Grade—there was only Number One Grade. The packers were always originating such schemes—they had what they called “boneless hams,” which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and “California hams,” which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out; and fancy “skinned hams,” which were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no one would buy them—that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled 'head cheese!'""

102c9b9dad7c,39c16e,"Three elements that make a tragedy ideal include being based on a complex plan,  a highly prosperous, average main character, and an unmerited issue. Aristotle writes that ""A perfect tragedy...not on the simple but on the complex plan."" This shows that a good tragedy must be complex if it is to rise above others. Aristotle also writes ""...a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about...by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned..."" This proves that Aristotle believes that the main character of a great tragedy must be a man who is neither good nor evil, but somewhere in between; and that that man must be prosperous or renowned. Finally, Aristotle states ""...pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves."" Therefore, if a tragedy were to display a man such as one described above, and have a random, unforeseen misfortune befall him, the audiences would easily be able to relate. In the world, no one knows what fate has in store, and this specific setting easily allows audience members to imagine themselves as the main character.

91368bc293b4,ebad26,"Upton Sinclair strengthens his argument that conditions were unsanitary in meat processing factories through describing the various ways in which workers would use or cover up spoiled meat. This included suppressing the odor through the use of borax and glycerin, adding more meat to cover the spoiled meat, filling hams with pickle, chopping spoiled meat to make ""sausage"", selling bad hams as ""Number Three Grade"", and through extracting the bone of bad ham and selling it as boneless ham. Since spoiled meat had a very strong odor to it, workers within factories had to ensure that consumers would not be able to smell it so that they would be more likely to buy and consume it. As a result, they used sweet smelling or odorless products in order to mask the stench. Hams were pickled with a machine that was both quick and effective, but would sometimes spoil the meat further. This detail further helped to support Sinclair's claim that factories mainly cared about making a profit rather than the health of their consumers. Additionally, factory workers used methods of hiding or covering up spoiled meat by making it more subtle through covering it with unspoiled meat or chopping it into smaller pieaces so it would go unnoticed by consumers. Lastly, Sinclair describes how spoiled ham was especially covered up through selling bad ham as ""Number Three Grade"" or ""smoked ham"". Later however, ""they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron"" (Sinclair 1906). This would eliminate the title of ""Number Three Grade"" in favor of ""boneless ham"".",3.14408917678279,3.42613276459037,Summarize the various ways the factory would use or cover up spoiled meat.

The plot is required to progress from beginning to end in an organized fashion of anticipated events. The end of the tragedy is responsible for tying up any loose ends. Character is the second most essential element of an ideal tragedy. The hero must begin the tragedy by embracing feelings of happiness. As the tragedy progresses, there must be a shift from happiness to misery, ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad."" The hero should be painted in a good way. In addition, the plot must always demand that of a tragic action which can be addressed with innocence or absolute awareness. Aristotle makes it very transparent to the readers that emotion plays a significant role in the formation of a tragedy.

1b82ce4967e9,39c16e,"One of the elements Aristotle claims is crucial to constructing an ideal tragedy is the emphasis on building a story out of pity and misfortune. As stated in paragraph 2, Aristotle remarks that "" It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" Aristotle is explaining how the best method of displaying tragedy in any poem is to put the main characters in a constant state of misfortune, which is meant to drive forward the narritive as it progresses. Next, Artistotle exclaims that the main character in a tragedy should never been considered ""good or bad"", but in between the two extremes. He claims in paragraph 2, ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity,  but by some error of judgement or frailty"". He emphasizes that the best way to craft a main character in a tragedy is not to witness a good man suffer from misfortune or a bad man pay for his crimes, but a simple man suffer for making mistakes that may be relatable to the reader themselves. Finally, Aristotle suggests that good tragedies must always involve particular families who have evil pasts. He explains this in paragraph 3 when he states, "" Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses — on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible."" This describes how building narratives based around icons of tragedies enhances the feelings of pity and misfortune when the main characters experince the tragedies themselves.",3.80272207089915,3.51483103434524,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

66db2c282419,39c16e," Three elements of an ideal tragedy that are described by Aristotle are plot, character, and diction. Plot should give a single issue and not double and should be from good to bad in terms of change of fortune. The fortune should come as a result of error in a character from better to worse and imitate pity and fear. Character should be defiant of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity from the spirit of Tragedy and possess no tragic qualities and related to the audience to create emotions. Diction or choice of words should be arranged in a simple, but complex plan and imitate actions of pity and fear, while also thoroughly satisifing moral sense and well-being. Evidence to support these statements are in paragraphs 2 and 3 where it reads, "" A plot of this kind would, doubtless, satisfy the moral sense, but it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves...A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse... the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty...A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity."" These pieces of evidence further support my assertion of the three main elements of an ideal tragedy being plot, character, and diction by showing the importance of a plot and its significance of portraying pity and fear and character and its importance of showing one's personality to be from adversity to prosperity, while showing the significance of diction and its well-being of providing a sense of pity and fear and satisying moral sense throughout the play and tragedy in its choice of words.",1.98471716382454,2.54906922938127,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

Scribes kept important governemnt documents, Priests where in charge of pleasing the gods, Nobles held certain government posts, and the greatest of all, Pharoes, where thought to be the ruler and or god of the land.

In paragraph one the author writes, ""For it was the custom, as they found, whenever mear was so spoiled that it could not be used for anything else, either to can it or else to chop it up into sausage."" This explains how they would put spoiled meat with fresh meat, instead of throwing the spoiled meat out. If the factory didn't put the spoiled meat in sausage, they would rub it with soda to take away the small, or they would use chemicals to enhance aspects of the meat. From paragraph two it states, ""...how the meat that was taken our of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose."" This explains there use of soda and chemicals to mask the spoiled meat. Next up, the factory would stuff ham with the spoiled meat using a machine and a needle. The text explains in paragraph two, ""... a cachine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by plunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds. And yet, in spite of this, there would be hams found spoiled..."" This evidence further describes how they would mask spoiled meat. Finally, once the factory discovered how to take the bone out of a ham, they would insert a white-hot iron, and they would go on to sell ""boneless hams"" or ""California hams"" and fancy ""skinned hams"" which all were filled with spoiled meat. However no one would buy skinned hams, until they were cooked, and chopped up fine, which they then called ""head cheese"". Evidence comes from paragraph two, ""...but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron. The packers were always originating such schemes—they had what they called “boneless hams,” which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and “California hams,” which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out; and fancy “skinned hams,” which were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no one would buy them—that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled “head cheese!” These lines of text explain the procedure that happened to the hams just for them to be sold. If Europe old sausage came back however, no matter how moldy or white it was, the factoru would dose it with borax and glycerin and then pack it with fresh meat just to sell again.

The quote above shows that the vizers had to make sure everyone paid their taxes.Also, the scribes worked with the vizers. The scribes kept government records. They could also read and write. In the text is says, ""Working with the vizier were scribes who kept government records. These high-level employees had mastered a rare skill in ancient Egypt — they could read and write."" This shows that they had an important skill and job. At the bottom of the structure were slaves and farmers. Slaves were forced to work on building projects. The slaves had to do hard labor. The farmers worked on the fields, raised aimals, kept canals and reservoirs in good shape, and much more. To prove that, the text states, ""Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles. Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments."" Farmers also paid taxes that could take away as much as 60% of their yearly-harvest.  As one can see, all people in ancient Egypt had  job, and that ancient Egypt's social structure is different from today. One can also see how different levels of social classes had different power. Egypt's system of government played a important role in ancient Egypt.

ee49145aa624,39c16e,"The Greek philosopher Aristotle described an ideal tragedy in literature in many defining aspects.  One of these is that a tragedy is complicated and heightens emotions such as remorse and fright as in the reader as the plot moves along.  Aristotle concludes, ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation.""  Due to this, Aristotle indicates how tragedies should be deeply thought out to provide an emotional experience in a reader.  Furthermore, a second aspect is how the changes throughout the plot will lead to a downfall of a character or event.  He demonstrates that the change should be ""not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad.""  Moreover, a third aspect of a tragedy is that the plot and storyline should follow one strict and sole storyline that will lead to the eventual negative outcome.  Aristotle suggests, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.""  To summarize, 3 elements of a tragedy from Aristotle are strong emotions stirring in a reader, the defeat of a major character or events in the plot, and one plotline that strictly follows the issue of this story until the tragic ending.",2.83495109138843,3.14321133114365,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

Workers lacked washing their hands, and the water that men washed their hands in was also ladled into sausages. Meat would be tumbled out on the floor in dust and dirt. Meat would fall onto surfaces where employees have spit thousand of times. As a result of this, meats were extremely treacherous. According to the text, it states, ""There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs."" The meat was also in a space where rats were present, causing rats to run across the meats. As a result of rats running around, they poison them. After poisoning the rats, the rats would go in the hopper with the meat while they are processing. Workers call the poisoned rat a tidbit, and they did not care to remove the rat from the meat. This was extremely unsanitary and cruel. According to the text, it states, ""There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms, and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it."" Workers were also capable of changing the meat into; however, they wanted them, such as turning the meat brown or making the meat ""unspoil."" They would use chemistry and machines to change spoiled meat. If it were so difficult to get these meats to change, they would sell it as a number three grade meat.

These ideas are most closely summed up when he writes, ""[t]he change of fortune should be...from good to bad"" (Paragraph 3). As well as when he continues on to note, ""[i]t should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse"" (Paragraph 3).

He starts out by describing actions, ""...excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (Artistole, 2). The meathod that the author should take, Artistole suggests, is one where actions of the characters promote feelings of remorse and a little bit of fear for the excitement. Another element Artistole believes is in an ideal tragedy is, ""the downfall of the utter villian be exhibited"" (Artistole, 2). Connecting this to Hamlet, this means that if Claudius is the villian, he shouldn't die because it would cause the audience to think of it as misfourtune. Finally, the third ideal trait that a true tragedy should posess is, ""some great error or frailty, in a chracter"" (Artistole, 3). This ultimatly means that the main character, the protagonist, shall do something utterly stupid that worsens his own life. This truly would be depressing as the audience would want to see the protagonist grow in his life which goes from bad to good instead of good to bad.

One technique used is found in Paragraph 2, where the story states that, ""In the pickling of hams they had an ingenious apparatus,1 by which they saved time and increased the capacity of the plant—a machine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by plunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds."" This small section shows that they tried to mask the rotting smell with pickle juice. However, the story goes on to say that failed. Paragraph 4 also shows the true nature of these factories, saying, ""There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs. There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it. It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats. These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together. This is no fairy story and no joke; the meat would be shoveled into carts, and the man who did the shoveling would not trouble to lift out a rat even when he saw one – there were things that went into the sausage in comparison with which a poisoned rat was a tidbit.""

Unsanitary animals would poop on the already dirty meat, only for men to wipe their dirty hands across it. What would be the final product?
