One of these is that a tragedy is complicated and heightens emotions such as remorse and fright as in the reader as the plot moves along.  Aristotle concludes, \"A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation.\"  Due to this, Aristotle indicates how tragedies should be deeply thought out to provide an emotional experience in a reader.  Furthermore, a second aspect is how the changes throughout the plot will lead to a downfall of a character or event.  He demonstrates that the change should be \"not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad.\"  Moreover, a third aspect of a tragedy is that the plot and storyline should follow one strict and sole storyline that will lead to the eventual negative outcome.  Aristotle suggests, \"A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.\"  To summarize, 3 elements of a tragedy from Aristotle are strong emotions stirring in a reader, the defeat of a major character or events in the plot, and one plotline that strictly follows the issue of this story until the tragic ending.',\n"," 'They would use many chemicals to cover the molids on the meat, or they would grind up the spoiled meat and mix it with fresher meat, they could put pickles in it to cover the smell, and lastly, they would cut up the ham into very small slices, ones that were small enough to not see the mold and have the smell become very noticeable.',\n"," 'it developed very fast since the other kids not in there class started to join in a follow the leader as it became more and more out of jones control he had to put a stop to the exspirament',\n"," 'The structure of the ancient Egyptian system of government is like a pyramid.

Scribes would work with the vizier and they kept government records. They could read and write which in the time, was a rare skill and they had mastered it (The Chain Of Command Section). Only nobles could hold government posts, in the social pyramid, they were right below the pharaoh (along with priests). They profited from tributes in these positions. Nobles had great status and grew very wealthy from the donations to the gods (Noble Aims Section). Soldiers fought in wars or put an end to domestic uprisings. They also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved with building structures like pyramids and palaces during long periods of time. Physicians and craftsmen and woman made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and much more. Merchants and storekeepers would sell these goods to the people (Soldier On Section). Now on the bottom of the social pyramid (or social structure as it is called in the article), slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. They were forced to work on building projects. They also worked extremely hard at the discretion of the pharoh or nobles. Wanting to change your social status was impossible to do. A very tiny number of peasants and farmers did go up in the economic ladder. Schools were ran by priests and artisans. Boys who could read and write would become scribes and would go into working for the government (The Bottom Of The Heap Section).

A character should not move from pure happiness to pure misfortune, or vise versa.

He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous...\" Throughout the paragraph Aristotle shows that a character should fall in between good and evil, which in turn can evoke more emotion in the audience rather than merely being shocked.

Next, Artistotle exclaims that the main character in a tragedy should never been considered \"good or bad\", but in between the two extremes. He claims in paragraph 2, \"that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity,  but by some error of judgement or frailty\". He emphasizes that the best way to craft a main character in a tragedy is not to witness a good man suffer from misfortune or a bad man pay for his crimes, but a simple man suffer for making mistakes that may be relatable to the reader themselves. Finally, Aristotle suggests that good tragedies must always involve particular families who have evil pasts. He explains this in paragraph 3 when he states, \" Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses — on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible.\" This describes how building narratives based around icons of tragedies enhances the feelings of pity and misfortune when the main characters experince the tragedies themselves.',\n"," 'An ideal tragedy should not be about a great man or evil man; just a normal man that people can relate to.
