ancient Egyptian government was run by a Pharoah. The Pharoah was considered a God or God-like and was very highly praised. They had control over all their subjects and citizens. They usually were built pyramids for their tombs. Under the Pharoah was a minister or vizier. The vizier's job was to collect taxes and to make sure everyone paid them.  Scribes worked with the vizier because they held government records. Scribes were important because they could read and write.  Then there were nobles and priests. Priests would feed and please the gods to make them happy.  Nobles would hold government posts and they profited from the gifts. There were also soldiers who would fight in wars. And workers such as craftsmen and women and physicians. They were in the middle class.  Then there were the merchants who sold goods to the citizens who bought them. At the bottom, there were farmers and slaves. The slaves were captured prisoners and they would be forced to work on buildings. Farmers did a lot for the Egyptians. They would take care of animals, tended the fields that provided food, kept canals, and worked in quarries. They did all this work and had to pay more than 50 % of their harvest in taxes.
