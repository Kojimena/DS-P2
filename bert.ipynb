This would mask the odor and allow for the food to be sold. The workers just did their job so no matter whar if the meat was spoiled they had this way and others to cover it up. All in all, the main way the factory would cover up spoiled meat would be to pickle it and act like its normal.

This must be a person who is not cruel but by no means is a good person. Aristotle speaks of this when he says \"There remains, then, the character between these two extremes\". The next ideal part of a tradegy is what he goes on to say next; the main plot must be that the protagonist must not fall due to his evil but due to a simple mistake. This point is a major part of what makes it relatable to the reader and therefore a greater story. One final element is the ending. The best tragidies will indeed have an unhappy ending, according to Aristotle. He supports this with his example of Euripides. This famous poet mostly ended his stories on an unhappy note, which Aristotle claims have the most tragic effect. Comined, Aristotle believes these elements will grant the highest range of tragic inflence.to Aristotle.

Throughout this article it tells us that no matter the color, flavor, or smell they would still sell the meat. These factories didn't care for the health of their consumers and only wanted to make money, so they sold every piece of meat that they could. While reading this article it sounds like they would never let a single piece of meat go to waste even if it was spoiled and covered in mold. In the article it states, “old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white – it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.”(3). This quote from the article explains to us how they covered up the molded meat by using strong and toxic chemicals to get rid of the smell and turn the meat back to brown. The factories had no health regulations, the meat was stored in places infested with germs. The factories knew how filthy their facility was and had put no effort in  to change it. In paragraph 4 it states, “There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs.”(4). This tells us how nobody cared about the condition the meat was in and how no one enforced them to follow any guidelines that had been put in place. Workers knew that what they were doing was wrong and never second guessed it, “a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats. These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together.”(4). This quote from the article tells the reader how they used rat meat for sausages. These rats contained many diseases and carried poison from eating contaminated  bread. Which they thought was right to feed  humans. In the factories, spoiled meat was covered up badly. Instead of throwing away the rotting meat they found ways to use it to seem consumable to humanity while they were making it much worse.\",\n"," 'The social structure of Egypt resembled its famous stone pyramids: smaller, more valued classes at the top and the larger, less valued classes at the base.',\n"," 'Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests.

Where you were placed on the pyramid depended on your amount of respect or power.  In the text, it states; \"Their leaders, called pharaohs, were believed to be gods in human form. They had absolute power over their subjects\" (para. 2) This shows that if you were to believed to be chosen by the gods then you would have power over others because of your status.

At the very top point of the pyramid are the gods. Here is the order from greatest to least: Egyptian Gods/Pharaohs,  nobles/priests, soldiers, craftmen/traders, and lastly farmers/slaves. The gods are at the highest position in status. They have the right to overpower everyone. Also, since everyone praises them they believe that the gods were responsible of many things as well. Like safety. Sometimes the pharaohs direct the army or create laws. As stated in the text, \"They had absolute power over their subjects...The pharaoh directed the army in case of a foreign threat or an internal conflict. All the laws were enacted at the discretion of the pharaoh.\" Because the pharaohs/gods couldn\\'t do all the duties themselves they have assistants called viziers which are chief ministers. They have the duty of collecting taxes from people like farmers. According to the article, \"No single person could manage all these duties without assistance. The pharaoh appointed a chief minister called a vizier as a supervisor. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected.\" Called a \"chain of command\" the viziers have assistants as well.  They are called scribes; they are the only ones who can read and write. Now under the whole chain of gods/pharaohs there are the nobles/priests. According to the text, the only people who can develop government posts are the nobles. And priests\\' duties are to keep the gods satisfied. Like said in the text, \"Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods.\" Also, the nobles grow very wealthy from recieving all the gifts of the gods from the subjects. Next are the soldiers. The soldiers fight in wars or end \"domestic uprisings.\" Also, they sometimes keep an eye on farmers, peasants, and slaves. As said in the article, \"Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings. During long periods of peace, soldiers also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces.\" Next comes the middle class which is made up of skilled people life artisans, craftmen/women, and physicians. The craftmen would create jewlery and other products and then sell them to make some money. They were known as the merchants and sorekeepers. \"Skilled workers such as physicians and craftsmen/women made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things. Naturally, there were people needed to buy goods from artisans and traders. These were the merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public.\" And at the bottom/base are the farmers and slaves. The farmers has to raise animals, take care of the fields, conduct some tasks in the stone quarries, construct royal monuments, and are responsible to keep the reservoirs and canals in shape. They also have to pay 60% of their annual harvest towards tax. \"Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs  in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest—that’s a lot of hay!\"  Although people can\\'t raise their status, young boys can go to school to learn how to read/write and then can become scribes or can apply for employment in the government which would make their status rise. The slaves have to work on developing projects and put extreme effort at the disrection of the nobles or pharaohs. \"At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers.

There job was too \"Make and sell jewelry, pottery, papyrus, products, tools, and other useful things.\" The middle class was an important part of the government. At the very bottom of the pyramid was the slaves and farmers. Slaves were forced to work on building projects, while farmers tended the fields for crops and food.

Not only are the factories willing to do this but the employees aswell.  Looking at this question of whether or not to use supplies to contaminate meat seems like a very simple answer. However, to the factory workers in the twentieth century, it was not. Not only was it not a simple answer there was no question.  \"There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it ... . It was too dark in these storage places to see well ... There was no place for the men to wash their hands before they ate their dinner\" (4-5) Sinclair goes on to explain that there was not an option for the workers, and the factory owners knew this.  They knew the workers needed the money to provide for their families.  To add to the atmosphere of the factories Sinclair says, \"With one member trimming beef in a cannery, and another working in a sausage factory, the family had a first-hand knowledge\" (1) The people were scared to step up for fear of backlash from their \"family\".   This is another example of things that factory owners used to control and cover up spoiled meat.

He also assumed that the character would endure a fall due to their own error of judgement in an ideal tragedy. As it should be \"brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.\" By this approach, the text represented it as being able to alter the audience\\'s perception of the personality and behavior of the character.

Second, he states in paragraph 3, \"Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses - on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible.\" This quote shows how the best tragedies focus on characters who were greatly affected by the tragedy, which makes it have a great plot. Lastly, in paragraph 3 he also states \"The best proof is that on the stage and in dramatic competition,\" which shows how diction and performance on the stage brings it to life and really makes it a great tragedy.

This character is flawed and down to earth in order for the audience to truly empathize with the hero's fatal flaw and sympathize with their great downfall. The plot of the story should follow the hero's fall from grace as a result of their behavior and the advancement of a heinous villain. The protagonist begins the story with good luck, then ends it with bad luck (and vice versa, in the antagonist's case). The most vital aspect of a tragedy is its ending. Tragedies must end unhappily. The hero must suffer a horrible ending and the villain is encouraged to prosper (or at least to win). This is to arouse deep seated feelings of fear and pity in the audience, feelings that they are usually disconnected with and tragedies were created to help the audience regulate their (often repressed) negativity by connecting with and learning from the protagonist's fate. \",\n"," 'pharoh were in charge of everything and had many responsibilitys. nobles had gozerment responsibilitys and help the pharoh.priests were expeted to please the gods the resived gifs for the gods.soliders fought but when the wernt needed the helped with many different things.craftsmen were resbosible for makeing good for trade and the people.farmers payed taxes of grian incase of foreign and tended to fields.slave were people captered so thay were responsible for biulding.',\n"," 'Egyptian society was structured like a pyramid.

Aristotle also used Oedipus, Orestes, and other tragic heroes from mythology in order to heavily emphasize that the flaw in the personality.

The second element of a tragedy is that the plot should contain a man neither good nor evil whose life falls apart from a mistake. A character should not move from pure happiness to pure misfortune, or vise versa. For example, in paragraph 2, Aristotle states, \"...here remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous...\" Throughout the paragraph Aristotle shows that a character should fall in between good and evil, which in turn can evoke more emotion in the audience rather than merely being shocked. The third element of a tragedy is that the complex storyline and plot should have the character\\'s fortune go from good to bad, because of a greater mistake created. Aristotle continues to mention this throughout paragraph 3 as the ending should always be in misfortune or unhappiness.

The main character has to be neutral, neither good nor evil. At the same time, a tragedy has to induce pity and fear. A tragedy can\\'t have \"the downfall of the utter villain be exhibited\" (Paragraph 2) because that wouldn\\'t bring fear or pity, but we rejoice instead. For a ideal tragedy, pity should be \"aroused by unmerited misfortune\" (Paragraph 2) and fear by \"the misfortune of a man like ourselves\" (Paragraph 2). The final element is that the main characters fortune \"should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad\" (Paragraph 3) and should be caused \"by some error of judgement or frailty\" (Paragraph 2).

The most important element of an ideal tragedy is based off of the plot.

The outcome of the main character will have come from some sort of great error or frailty, the ideal tragic hero should be an all good man with a very minor flaw in his character, and the entire tragedy should be continued upon this judgement. Aristotle also explains how a the plot should be a very complex plan where the actions of the characters exemplify emotions such as pity and fear with the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. He suggests that the best sorts of a tragedy are the complex plots that arouse both pity and fear. He then explains how a good plot must avoid a hero becomming miserable, avoid the transition from misery to happiness for an the antagonist, and also avoid the antagonist to feel happiness and leading into one\\'s misery. He simply just believes that the best plot derives from the mistrtune of someone and whose future downfall leads to an error in judgement. The second element includes the character\\'s actions and personality. To Aristotle, the character must be set up for failure even though this character has the personality of a \"good character.\" The show , \"follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear; it merely shocks us. Nor, again, that of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity: for nothing can be more alien to the spirit of Tragedy; it possesses no single tragic quality; it neither satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear,\" (Aristotle, 2).  Meaning this, the overall sense and focus of the play should not be based on the hero losing his \"good.\" Instead, the character must make multiple judgements and go through an entire storyline, not aware of the downfall set right for him. The final element of an ideal tragedy is the spectacle and production itself. Although Aristotle does not go fully into the details regarding this element, in paragraph 3, it is noted that \" A tragedy, then, to be perfect according to the rules of art, should be of this construction....because he follows this principle in his plays, many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending. The best proof is that on the stage and in dramatic competition, such plays, if well worked out, are the most tragic in effect\" (Aristotle, 3). Rather than explaining the scenic visuals of the play and visual effects of a \"spectacle,\" Aristotle explains that the true spectacle is the dramatic competition and the tragedy in effect.

Aristotle also goes on to say that the protagonist in a tragedy should not be someone who is perfect and saint-like, but it also should not be someone who is evil. He says, \"There remains, then, the character between these two extremes-that of a man who is not emminently good and just, yet whose mistfourtune is brough about not by vice,\" (Paragraph 2).  The final element that, accodring to Aristotle, makes an ideal tragegy is the change of fourtune. He says, \"the change of fourtune should not be from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad,\" (Paragraph 3).
