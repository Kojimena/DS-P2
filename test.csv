The teacher created a movement which he encouraged for the students to join. The movement's purpose was to eliminate democracy, and one of the central points that Jones provided was that, "" democracy's main weakness is that it favors the individual over the whole community"" ( The Third Wave 1).  Moreover, he encouraged them even more to join by creating a catchy motto that read, ""Strength through discipline, stregth through community, strength throught action, strength through pride"" ( The Third Wave 1). When the students joined the movement, not only they followed every single rule put by Jones, rules such as calling him Mr.Jones for every remark they wanted to make. They had to be sitted and oaying attention before the second bell, had to stand up every time one asked a question with three words or fewer. These were strict rules, rules that they were not used to. Yet, they followed them.

eb76bd210a89,39c16e,"One element of an ideal tragedy, as summarized by Aristotle, is that there should be a serious change in circumstances of the main character, specifically a change from good circumstances to bad, instead of bad to good. Aristotle says ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad."" Aristotle argues that if the fortune changed from bad to good, then it wouldn't invoke any feelings of pity in us, as it wouldn't be considered a tragedy if a character's fortune increased throughout the play, as this would be a good thing. Aristotle also says a good tragedy should portray a character who is somewhere in the middle between being inherently good and inherently bad. He says ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes - that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty."" Essentially, Aristotle is saying that the main character shouldn't be too good, as this wouldn't invoke any pity, however, the character also shouldn't be too evil, or else the audience wouldn't feel sorry for him and his bad misfortune. Lastly, Aristotle says a good tragedy should exhibit a character experiencing misfortune due to a flaw in his character, not necessarily because of bad or immoral behaviror. He says ""It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse."" Overall, Aristotle argues that a good tragedy should portray a character who is neither good nor bad, but rather somewhere in the middle, who experiences a change of fortune from good to bad due to some inherent flaw of his character.

The plot of an ideal tragedy is a man that is neither good nor evil whose life falls apart because of a mistake. The tragedy must pass feelings of terror and commotion to the public, it should be highly emotional and precise. A tragedy also must have intimate language and actions that engage the readers and excite pity and fear. The language and actions bring different ambiances and excitement throughout. The language should be pleasant and easily understood by the audience. A tragedy must have true tragic endings and not resemble comedies. An example of a comedy, not a tragedy is when those who are enemies leave the stage as friends at the end, and no one kills or is killed. It is overused and clichÃ©. A tragedy must have death, successes, losses, and different feelings so people can become engaged and feel the emotions.

It was believed that Gods and Goddesses like Ra, Osiris, and Isis controlled the universe at their whim. Pharaohs were believed to be living Gods in human form and given great power and responsibility. Assisting the Pharaoh was the vizier, or tax collector who used scribes, or high-level, literate record keepers. Below the Pharaohs were Nobles and Priests. Nobles held government posts and profited off of tributes to the Pharaoh while Priests held responsibility to please the Gods. One tier lower are Soldiers and Skilled Workers, or Artisans. Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings, also supervising slaves, peasants, and farmers in peacetime. Artisans such as physicians and craftsmen were middle-class people, Craftsmen making and selling jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things. To stimulate the economy, there were merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public. At the bottom of the proverbial barrel are Slaves and Farmers. Slaves were captured Prisoners of War, forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the whim of the pharaoh and nobles. Farmers tended fields, raised animals, kept waterways in good order, worked in the quarries, and built royal monuments. Farmers paid as much as 60% of their yearly harvest as tax.

The pyramid of social structure was made up of three parts: The Upper class, the Middle class, and the Lower class. The Upper class was filled up by pharaohs, the Middle class was filled up by priests, nobles, craftsmen, scribes, and merchants, and the Lower class was filled by slaves, and farmers. Now, all of these places were connected to the government. Their government was basically warshiping gods and goddessess. The pharaoh was connected to the government, because he of she was the ruler of Egypt, ""Their leaders, called pharaohs, were blieved to be gods in human form"" (paragraph, 2). The pharaohs were thought of as gods and godessess, they were thought of as walking gods. The Middle class was connected to the government because they either helped the pharaoh directly, or they had sustainable jobs to sell things to people, ""Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tribute paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods... Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings.

d377fe983b65,39c16e,"According to Aristotle, 3 elements of an ideal tragedy include being complex, being emotional, and having a character go from good to bad fortune. First, Aristotle explains that ""a perfect tragedy should be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan"". (Aristotle 2). Aristotle continues by suggesting that the tragedy should ""imitate actions which excite pity and fear"" and calls this the ""distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (Aristotle 2). This desire for readers to feel pitiful and fearful leads to Aristotle's second element of an ideal tragedy; for it to be emotional. Aristotle claims that an emotional piece ""is proper rather to Comedy,"" suggesting that all tragedies should end with the reader feeling sorrow. (Aristotle 4). Lastly, the author states that the ideal tragedy ""should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad"" (Aristotle 3). Aristotle believes that the ideal tragedy should include ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgment or frailty"" (Aristotle 3).",2.17293236566335,0.239216658363737,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

To save time and increase their capacity, they used a machine that would be able to pickle a ham in a few seconds, but would sometimes leave the hams spoiled with a disgusting odor. To solve this issue, the packers used a stronger pickle. After smoking the hams, some would be found to have gone bad but were still sold to the public as ""Number Three Grade"". To solve this problem, they decided to extract the bone and insert a white-hot iron, getting rid of all but Number One Grade. To be able to keep selling to the general public, the packers made up numerous schemes and ""they had what they called 'boneless hams,' which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and 'California hams,' which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out; and fancy 'skinned hams,' which were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no  one would buy them--that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled 'head cheese!'""

5319cec5a6d6,39c16e,"Aristotle made clear many elements that need to be present to construct an ideal tragedy. Though he stresses many ideas, they all fall into general elements that must be included, which includes the actions must spark pity and fear, the change in fortune should be from good to bad, and this shift shouldn't be due to one's bad habits rather from an error of judgment or frailty. Aristotle wrote, ""it should moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (2). He not only states that it should create the feeling of pity and fear, but also states that these two feelings are distinctive marks of tragedies. This helps to explain why he stresses how the story should change, ""not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad"" (3). Tragedies are supposed to be sad and make the reader feel bad for the character which a story from good to bad does, while a story from bad to good  expresses the feeling of achievement and reshapes for the better. Lastly he describes the element of how misfortune is not brought by, ""Vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty""(2). He said the character can't be a villain because this wouldn't be a tragedy and the person couldn't be someone known for being good. It must be a renowned and prosperous person whose misfortune happens because he makes a wrong judgment or bad choice instead of something they have always done like a habit. Aristotle made the elements of tragedy, expressing pity and fear, making sure it was good to bad, and that it wasn't a normal error of the person rather bad judgment, clear through his writing.",3.6262817507338,2.20429441467864,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

The experiment was a demonstation of how people followed crowds even when terrible things were happening.  Jones developed an authoritative dictatorship in his classroom to teach students about the German mentality. He made rules in his classroom such as; students had to stand up when asking or answering questions, students had to answer in three words, and students should salute each other in and out of school. On the forth day, Jones ended the experiment when he felt it was slipping out of his control.

This perfectly explains why pharaohs were at the top of the pyramid because the text also says the following: ""Egyptians believed that the gods controlled the universe. Therefore, it was important to keep them happy."" What better way to make somebody happy than making them rich and powerful? The next rung on the ladder was the one held by nobles and priests, however, these were not much lower than the pharaohs. Quote: ""Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions, they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods.""  This clearly shows that while below pharaohs, nobles and priests were still majorly important in Egyptian culture. Next were physicians and craftsmen. Quoted here, ""Skilled workers such as physicians and craftsmen/women made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things."" The middle class was still needed and wanted, unlike the bottom of the pyramid, which was farmers and slaves. As I quote here, ""At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers. Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles.""

1acf92125772,39c16e,"Three of the main elements of a great tragedy are as follows: actions that incite pity and fear, a change of fortune from good to bad, and the exclusion of the utter downfall of the villian. Aritsotle explains that the feeling of pity and fear is ""the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (2). In order for one to incite those feelings from an audience, someone who is neither fully good, nor bad, has to befall a misfortune. This misfortune has to come from a good place and change circumstances for the worse. ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty..."" (Aristotle 3). This means that in order to have a good tradegy, one must have a main character make a costly mistake that causes them great hardship. The last element of a good tragedy is the avoidance of the utter downfall of a villain, because, according to Aristotle, ""...it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves"" (2). And as stated earlier, pity and fear are one of the most necessary components to an ideal tragedy, so if villian dies a horrible death, the story won't have the necessary components. If that story has these three main elements - pity and fear, misfortune, and the avoidance of the downfall of a villian, it would make a great tragedy.",2.80301320236021,1.58900654208131,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

It isn't as satisfying for the audience to see a good person face misfortune, or to see a bad person go through hardship, so the hero must be neither bad nor good, but in between. Second, Aristotle asserts that the character's life must go from good to bad, instead of bad to good. There must be a decline in the character's fate that culminates in a disaster that doesn't end well for him. Lastly, Aristotle believes that the bad ending for the protagonist must come as a result of their own mistake.

He wanted to show the students first hand how this movement worked. He announced that he was starting a movement to eliminate democracy, and he started to get his students involved immediately. Jones instilled extensive rules and proper disciplinary skills into his students by the end of the first day. The movement picked up steam, and by the third day, the movement expended to over 40 students. They even had a salute resembling that of the Nazi regime. Everyone obeyed Jones. However, by the fourth day, more than 200 students joined in on the bandwagon, and the experiment was getting out of control. Therefore, Jones decided to end it by tricking his students into thinking that the Third Wave was a nationwide movement and that a Presidential Candidate would officially confirm its existence. in the end, that definitely did not happen.

eadfbab27103,39c16e,"There are many elements to an ideal tragedy according to ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle. To begin with, character is a big element in order to achieve an ideal tragedy. Aristotle talks about how a character should not be a bad man or virtuos man, but a man in between those two extremes. A man who is not eminently good and just, yet their downfall is caused byerror of judgement or frailty. Some examples are Oedupis or Thyestes. This is because they are relatable to the viewers and pity or excitement can not be aroused  from simple adversity to prosperity or prosperity to adversity. Another key element is the plot. It should be a single plot where change of fortune should be from good to bad. Some of the greatest tragedies like the fortunes of Oedipus or Alcmaeon can back this up. Lastly, the ending is also a major facet of the ideal tragedy. Although the ending may not satisfy the viewers, if done right, it can be the most tragic like Euripides.",2.55061546647052,2.4614138382119,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

c1fbcbaa92b2,39c16e,"There are many elements to make an ideal tragedy. These include a single issued, well-constructed plot that has one main idea rather than multiple that strive away from the story arc of the play. Another element of a tragedy should have a complex plan with intimate actions depicting and exciting the emotions of pity and fear, marking the play as a tragedy and something we can relate to.

25e459261b79,39c16e,"Aristotle was one the smartest philosopher's at this time and had many opinions on how a tragedy should be written. Firstly,  Aristotle believed that a plot should be complicated rather than simple. The text states ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan"" (Aristotle). This quote shows how he believes a complicated plot is a necessity for tragedy. Aristotle  also believed that a tragedy should cause pity and fear in the audience. in paragraph 2, the text states, "" It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (Aristotle). This once again brings up the topic of catharsis otherwise known as emotional release. Aristotle believes that a true tragedy should make the audience feel pity and frightened and be able to release these emotions because of the show. Aristotle also believed that the characters should be relatable to invoke this fear into the people. The text states, ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity"" (Aristotle). This explains how a charcter that is morally grey, as most humans are, will be more relatable and make the audience feel pity. They will also be scared, because they do not want this to happen to themselves. Lastly,  Aristotle believes that these plays should end tragically or else it is second tiered.  The article states "" The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure. It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies â like Orestes and Aegisthus â quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain"" (Aristotle). In this he is explaining that without the unhappy ending, it doesnt not give the audience 'true tragic pleasure'. This is what Aristotle charcterized Greek tragedies by during his time as a philosopher.",3.49673982824454,3.60844082805949,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13
