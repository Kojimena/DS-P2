9e5f7a7f8af1,3b9047,"    The social structure of classes in Ancient Egypt, weren't very different from todays social structure. The pyramid of social structure was made up of three parts: The Upper class, the Middle class, and the Lower class. The Upper class was filled up by pharaohs, the Middle class was filled up by priests, nobles, craftsmen, scribes, and merchants, and the Lower class was filled by slaves, and farmers. Now, all of these places were connected to the government. Their government was basically warshiping gods and goddessess. The pharaoh was connected to the government, because he of she was the ruler of Egypt, ""Their leaders, called pharaohs, were blieved to be gods in human form"" (paragraph, 2). The pharaohs were thought of as gods and godessess, they were thought of as walking gods. The Middle class was connected to the government because they either helped the pharaoh directly, or they had sustainable jobs to sell things to people, ""Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tribute paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods... Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings. During long periods of peace, soldiers also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces"" (paragraph, 6 and 8).

The plot itself should not simply tell the series of events that occur in the story. Rather, it should focus on how the story can be presented in a way to evoke emotions from the audience, such as pity and fear. The characters in a tragedy should also not start from a spot of despair and work towards success. While a basic development from fortune to adversity would also not be ideal for a tragedy, adding more complexity to this story and including aspects that encourage fear or pity would contribute to developing an ideal tragedy. The construction of how the characters reach their final downfall is also a significant element of an ideal tragedy. For instance, not only should a character have a level of relatability to them, but they should also meet their downfall in a unfortunate and undeserving manner. Often, the story should be planned out so that the character goes into ruin despite their morals or intentions.

Workers lacked washing their hands, and the water that men washed their hands in was also ladled into sausages. Meat would be tumbled out on the floor in dust and dirt. Meat would fall onto surfaces where employees have spit thousand of times. As a result of this, meats were extremely treacherous. According to the text, it states, ""There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs."" The meat was also in a space where rats were present, causing rats to run across the meats. As a result of rats running around, they poison them. After poisoning the rats, the rats would go in the hopper with the meat while they are processing. Workers call the poisoned rat a tidbit, and they did not care to remove the rat from the meat. This was extremely unsanitary and cruel. According to the text, it states, ""There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms, and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it."" Workers were also capable of changing the meat into; however, they wanted them, such as turning the meat brown or making the meat ""unspoil."" They would use chemistry and machines to change spoiled meat. If it were so difficult to get these meats to change, they would sell it as a number three grade meat. According to the text, it states, ""Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be found some that had gone to the bad. Formerly these had been sold as ""Number Three Grade,"" but later on, some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron."" The workers also rubbed meat in soda to get meat to go from sour to sweet and change the bad odor. After doing this, they would provide it to people over the free lunch counter.

A second element of an ideal tragedy is that the tragedy has to highlight the downfall of a character that readers can relate to. Relating to the character can help the readers feel more understandable of the incident that the character goes through, and because the character has to be relatable to the audience, the audience will see a little part of themselves in the character, which makes them feel pity. A third element of an ideal tragedy is that a tragedy should not resemble a comedy. A tragedy has to be serious, in order for the audience to feel fear, pity, and slight sympathy towards a character. Comedic feelings would cancel out the feelings of fear and pity which would harm the true meaning of a tragedy.

What he means by it should excite pity and fear is that you should begin to feel emotions for the characters in the tragedy and be able to feel these emotions while reading it.

There has to be a bundle of emotions to make the audience feel a certain way for the character.

This means that there should be a plot that goes from good to bad. This provides an emotional connection to the character with their successes, but as the ""bad"" part comes in, you wil feel for the character. In the chapter from Poetics,  Aristotle states, ""It is accounted the best because of the weakness of the speactator; for the poet is guided in what he writes by the wishes of his audience"" (Paragraph 4). If you write the ending in the audiences wishes, they will be more intrigued. It's in the best wishes that the poet ends the writing in the audiences wishes, it will result in pleasure. All in all, the three elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle are having a complex plan,  have a well constructed plot, and end in pleasure to the audience.",3.40169912276593,3.01338025586439,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

This small section shows that they tried to mask the rotting smell with pickle juice. However, the story goes on to say that failed. Paragraph 4 also shows the true nature of these factories, saying, ""There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs. There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it. It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats. These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together. This is no fairy story and no joke; the meat would be shoveled into carts, and the man who did the shoveling would not trouble to lift out a rat even when he saw one – there were things that went into the sausage in comparison with which a poisoned rat was a tidbit.""

This also appeals to the moral sense because we don't like to see unjust consequences for a character's actions. As a result of this, Aristotle concludes that the character must not be too good as watching a good character do evil is just shocking, but not one too bad, as then the audience will feel the character deserves misfortune.

The teacher created a movement which he encouraged for the students to join. The movement's purpose was to eliminate democracy, and one of the central points that Jones provided was that, "" democracy's main weakness is that it favors the individual over the whole community"" ( The Third Wave 1).  Moreover, he encouraged them even more to join by creating a catchy motto that read, ""Strength through discipline, stregth through community, strength throught action, strength through pride"" ( The Third Wave 1). When the students joined the movement, not only they followed every single rule put by Jones, rules such as calling him Mr.Jones for every remark they wanted to make. They had to be sitted and oaying attention before the second bell, had to stand up every time one asked a question with three words or fewer. These were strict rules, rules that they were not used to. Yet, they followed them.

Such as characters, the set up of the movie or play, how they dress and sound and other things along that line. Spectacle can occur in tragedy because everything isn't as it seems.

91368bc293b4,ebad26,"Upton Sinclair strengthens his argument that conditions were unsanitary in meat processing factories through describing the various ways in which workers would use or cover up spoiled meat. This included suppressing the odor through the use of borax and glycerin, adding more meat to cover the spoiled meat, filling hams with pickle, chopping spoiled meat to make ""sausage"", selling bad hams as ""Number Three Grade"", and through extracting the bone of bad ham and selling it as boneless ham. Since spoiled meat had a very strong odor to it, workers within factories had to ensure that consumers would not be able to smell it so that they would be more likely to buy and consume it. As a result, they used sweet smelling or odorless products in order to mask the stench. Hams were pickled with a machine that was both quick and effective, but would sometimes spoil the meat further. This detail further helped to support Sinclair's claim that factories mainly cared about making a profit rather than the health of their consumers. Additionally, factory workers used methods of hiding or covering up spoiled meat by making it more subtle through covering it with unspoiled meat or chopping it into smaller pieaces so it would go unnoticed by consumers. Lastly, Sinclair describes how spoiled ham was especially covered up through selling bad ham as ""Number Three Grade"" or ""smoked ham"". Later however, ""they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron"" (Sinclair 1906). This would eliminate the title of ""Number Three Grade"" in favor of ""boneless ham"".",3.14408917678279,3.42613276459037,Summarize the various ways the factory would use or cover up spoiled meat.

64f540d9f37d,3b9047,"The text says that the social structure works similar to that of a pyramid.  At the top, of course, is the gods. Because, I mean, THEY'RE GODS. Underneath them is the Pharohs. This is due to the fact that people believe that the Pharohs were the human versions of the gods. The Pharohs held the most responsiblility and were the most powerful. They were also buried within stone pyramids. Beneath the Pharohs lies the Nobles, who essentially were the government. To quote from the text, they ""profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh."" Oh yeah, and the Preists (also up here with the Nobles) had the job of making sure that the gods were happy, and didn't hypothetically cause the destruction of humanity,  but THAT DOESN'T MATTER. Anyways, next is the middle class. the middle class, of course, was in the middle.  It contained craftsmen(men refering to both men and women, plus the possible addition of nonbinary peeps if the term hypothetically existed at the time) and shopkeepers. But what did they make? What did they sell? Well what do YOU think?? Ok, I might understand if you were having trouble figuring out what craftsmen did(which was make things such as jewlery,pottery, and tools by the way),  but shopkeepers??? I think you might be able to find out yourself. OK, MOVING ON, we have soldiers. Who, in most societies, you might expect to be higher than the middle class, but NOPE. THEY'RE AT THE BOTTOM. Well, not at the bottom, but.. Let's just say that in the egyptian society, you're either at the top, or at the bottom. And, despite the existence of the middle class, THERE IS NO INBETWEEN. So, yeah. Soldiers. They uh, fought in wars, of course, and they also supervised the peaseants and farmers...That's all I really know. Sorry. Alright, and now the moment in which you bois n gals n nonbinary pals have all been waiting for...the absolute bottom...the lowest of the lows...drumroll please...SLAVES AND FARMERS, YALL! Aight so slaves were essentially made out of a whole bunch of peeps who were taken captive during war, and such. They were used to work on building projects, and let's be honest, were probably treated like crap. And farmers, on the other hand, were...FARMERS! And they did, uh...Very..Farmer-y things. They..THEY WERE FARMERS. They also helped build royal monuments, and, to quote from the text, ""paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest"". So, if their yearly harvest were hypothetically around, let's say...$10,000, then they'd be left with...*calculating*...$4,000. So, when it came to taxes, farmers, too, WERE TREATED. LIKE. CRAP. (and I personally dont think that the farmers should be so low because unlike everyone else, they make the food that's KEEPING EVERYONE ELSE A L I V E. that's just how I see it thought.)",1.95973486837533,2.34761934470339,"In complete sentences, summarize the structure of the ancient Egyptian system of government.

The main reason that the experiment was able to grow as fast as it did in the short amount of time that it was active was because of the way that the experiment looked to those outside of it. The author says ""All of the students were issued a member card and each of them received a special assignment, like designing a Third Wave Banner, stopping non-members from entering the class, or other tasks to bring honor to the movement,"" (CommonLit 3). It is common knowledge that envy and jealousy are present in every human being, and this must be the reason that so many outside students joined. As described in the quote, there were many things within the experiment that were exclusive of outside students. The students out of the experiment must have felt a desire to join in with the other students, an indirect form of peer pressure, if you will. The experiment was ended early due to its rapidly increasing intensity, and the operator of the experiment feared what would become of it were it to continue, thus he ended it. Jones' fear is expressed in the quote, ""By the fourth day of the experiment, the students became increasingly involved in the project and their discipline and loyalty to the project was so outstanding that Jones felt it was slipping out of control,"" (CommonLit 5).

They had absolute power, and when they died they were buried in tombs, which were huge stone pyramids.  Pharoahs were entrusted to providing protection and all laws were inacted by Pharoahs.  Pharoahs needed help with all their duties, and  often appointed a cheif minister called a vizier.  The vizier ensured that taxes were collected, also,  the Pharoah directed the army to protect the people.   Below the Pharoahs, were powerful nobles and preists.  Only nobles profited and could hold positions in government, and preists were responsible for pleasing the gods.  Nobles grew rich and enjoyed great status from donations to the gods.  Next,  soldiers supervised peasants, farmers, and slaves.  They fought wars and stopped uprisings.  Also, skilled workers such as craftsmen and doctors were the middle class.  At the bottom of the social structure were farmers and slaves.  Farmers tended the fields, raised animals,  kept reservoirs in good order, and worked in built the royal monuments.

It should be relatable for the audience to relate to the tragic life of a common virtuous man who is neither bad nor good. This common man has to make a tragic mistake that the audience can feel a cathartic experience in the sense that the events that occur are not all one-sided but rather a creation of simple mistakes. Aristotle also highlights that the complex plot be something that is focused on comedy or second rank tragedies, but rather it should be something he describes as true tragic pleasure. True tragic pleasure is one that works out an ending where it ends unhappily and dramatically, after it's been constructed efficiently.

In this passage,  Aristotle outlines the faults in some so called ""tragedies,"" and what caused others to succeed. The entire point of tragedy is to invoke a deep and true feeling of pity or sadness in the reader, something they can relate to on some level. a man going from rich to poor does not invoke these feelings, and neither does a man going from rags to riches. Villians falling and heroes rising cause opposite emotions than what is to be striven for in a tragedy, so a true tragedy has to have a merely ok character, usually with a moral compass that is skewed. As the focus on this one mediocre man, they shouldn't be taken on tangents that stray from the one main topic of the story of this man.

eadfbab27103,39c16e,"There are many elements to an ideal tragedy according to ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle. To begin with, character is a big element in order to achieve an ideal tragedy. Aristotle talks about how a character should not be a bad man or virtuos man, but a man in between those two extremes. A man who is not eminently good and just, yet their downfall is caused byerror of judgement or frailty. Some examples are Oedupis or Thyestes. This is because they are relatable to the viewers and pity or excitement can not be aroused  from simple adversity to prosperity or prosperity to adversity. Another key element is the plot. It should be a single plot where change of fortune should be from good to bad. Some of the greatest tragedies like the fortunes of Oedipus or Alcmaeon can back this up. Lastly, the ending is also a major facet of the ideal tragedy. Although the ending may not satisfy the viewers, if done right, it can be the most tragic like Euripides.",2.55061546647052,2.4614138382119,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

32f23f665431,39c16e,"According to this reading, Aristotle views the concept of an ideal tragedy by using elements of six different parts, but the most important according to him, are elements of plot, character, and thought. First, the element of the plot for an ideal strategy is meant to be the soul of the overall tragedy as a whole, and its main responsibility to keep every other factor that is part of a tragedy together. Aristotle believes that the plot should always be provided a beginning, middle, and end, in a proper way.  ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.""(Paragraph. 3) Overall, Aristotle's belief of the concept regarding plot is to be an imitation of an action, a single action. Second, the element of the character for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered as neither good nor bad, as a result, should instead be considered as a surprise to the audience of the character's morals. ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes.""(Paragraph 2) Aristotle thinks that if the tragic hero were to be better than one to be good or bad, then the tragedy as a whole would be seen as stronger than before. Third, the element of the thought for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered always on the type of situation being given, whether it is an individual who lives in prosperity or an individual who lives in adversity. ""yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.""(Paragraph 2) In terms of thought, the thoughts that should be considered is if the kind of unexpected sort of events happens should they belong to the wealthy or the poor, because of someone's poor sense of judgement or by fate.

He went on to describe in detail the horriable unsafe, disgusting, and moraliy wrong prosses that of which the meat was packaged. One thing the industery would do is putting many chemicals into the rotten meat to make it look better so that people would buy it.  As seen in the novel, ""Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell [...] also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose. In the pickling of hams they had an ingenious apparatus, by which they saved time and increased the capacity of the plant—a machine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by plunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds. [...]  Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be found some that had gone to the bad. Formerly these had been sold as “Number Three Grade,” but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron.""(Sinclair 2). This qoute shows how the industery would use jsut about any means to sell the meat they had even if it ment using unsafe means to change it completly. Such as droping loads of rotten meat into tubs of vinager and leaving it so that it would be more appealing.  In ""The Jungle"" it also states, ""Some of it they would make into ""smoked"" sausage – but as the smoking took time, and was therefore expensive, they would call upon their chemistry department, and preserve it with borax and color it with gelatin to make it brown."" (Sinclair 5). This qoute shows one of the many dangerous chemicals they would put in the meat, as borax is a cleaning tool. Eatting could lead to death as seen in www.medicalnewstoday.com it states, ""Borax is not safe to ingest. According to the NLM's Toxicology Data Network, borax is easy for the body to break down when either inhaled or swallowed. However, if inhalation or ingestion occurs, both serious poisoning and organ damage can result.""(Wilson 2019).

3971e6ab3679,39c16e,"    3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle includes a well-contructed plot, a tragedy arranged on a complex plan, and it needs to bring emotion from readers. Primarily, Aristotle discusses about the importance of constructing a plot that goes from good to bad. Having a good to bad plot will lead to an ""end unhappily. It is... the right ending."" If this plot is able to work, the most tragic effect will be the outcome because it satifies ""the moral sense, [and' inspires pity or fear."" Moreover, an ideal tragedy needs to build emotions from readers. The perfect tragedy must ""imitate actions which excite pity and fear"" which is achieved by a change of fortune from good to bad. Aristotle makes it clear that emotions are able to occur when ""some great error or frailty"" happens that changes the character from descriptions mentioned before which makes a character go from good to bad. Lastly, a tragedy should be built on a complex plan. For a complex plan, the audience should feel pity for a character which would later be used against the audience. Trying to reverse the effects of making the audience feel pity to fear is key for a perfect tragedy as ""it is accounted the best because of the weakness of the spectators."" Poets need to take audiences by surprise because it's similar to killing off the main character of a movie, for it would bring in tons of emotion and catch the audience off guard of something they would never expect to happen. All in all, Aristotle tries to convey his point of how to create a perfect tragedy and demonstrates how thoughtful and impactful a tragedy could be. However, Aristotle wants to make it more known that a short story can be constructed in an emotionally compelling way part of which still applies even in modern times.",3.00564245659694,3.22629229077931,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

First, Aristotle explains that ""a perfect tragedy should be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan"". (Aristotle 2). Aristotle continues by suggesting that the tragedy should ""imitate actions which excite pity and fear"" and calls this the ""distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (Aristotle 2). This desire for readers to feel pitiful and fearful leads to Aristotle's second element of an ideal tragedy; for it to be emotional. Aristotle claims that an emotional piece ""is proper rather to Comedy,"" suggesting that all tragedies should end with the reader feeling sorrow. (Aristotle 4). Lastly, the author states that the ideal tragedy ""should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad"" (Aristotle 3). Aristotle believes that the ideal tragedy should include ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgment or frailty"" (Aristotle 3).",2.17293236566335,0.239216658363737,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

The tragedy shoud evoke a sense of pity as well as fear onto the audience over a character who does not move from prosperity to adversity (it is just shocking, not pitiful or fearful) or a character that does not face misfortune when they do not deserve it. Additonally, the swap of fortune should be from good to bad rather than bad to good, resulting in an unhappy ending. This, according to Aristotle, hightens the dramatic reaction to the tragedy. Lastly, Aristotle claims the perfect tragedy should be proper instead of comedic, should have conflict such as relationship changes and characters who are slain, and it should have plot in which is ""double-threaded"".

c1b0930633de,3b9047,"The structure of the ancient Egyptian system of government was that there would be the pharaohs, the people who idolized them. But also priests and scribes. They were also considered as one of the high classes since they also had an important role in Ancient Egypt. Next there were also soldiers, craftsmen. These people were in the middle, which meant they do have an important role in Ancient Egypt. But there are not much idolized like the pharaohs. These types of people worked hard also because craftsmen and soliders always had to work for the pharaohs will. Craftsmen also had to make goods for anybody in Acient Egypt, and thats a lot to keep up with. But for soldiers they always had to protect Ancient Egypt and the pharaohs most of all. Now all the way at the bottom we have slaves, and the farmers. For them it wasway harder to live life then any other person. They would always have high taxes, make sure they did everything for the pharaohs, and also they were against their will for anything. All of these structures how they worked as a government together was very surprising also because they had a great civilization for many years. Text to prove this is that in the article it states ""Egyptain society was structed like a pymarid"". ""At the top were the gods, such as Ra, Osiris, and Isis"". This showed how the structure of their government and society was like a pyramid because there were types of people in every group that made them different. For that reason the pharaohs were always on top of the list because they were more important then any other group then. It also states in the text that ""At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers"". ""Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war"". ""In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles.""

He made the students attend a rally where he announced that this was an experiment to show how people willingly follow the crowd or create a sense of superitory over others leading to horrible things.

Pharaoh's were the next and egyptians believed Pharaoh's were gods but in human forms and they had absolute power over their subjects which is stated on paragraph 2. The pharaoh directed an army  in case of a foreign threat or an internal conflict stated on paragraph 3. All laws were enacted at the discretion of the pharaoh. Each farmer paid taxes in the form of grains, which were stored in the pharaoh's warehouses. This grain was used to feed the people in the event of a famine stated on paragraph 3.  The pharaoh appointed a cheif minister called a vizier as a supervisor. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected stated on paragraph 4. Working with the vizier were scribes who kept government records. These high-level employess had mastered a rare skill in ancient Egypt, they could read and write stated on paragraph 5. Below pharaoh's were nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts, which in these positions they profited from tributes, paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods stated on paragraph 6. Soliders fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings. During long periods of peace, soilders also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building structures like pyramids and palaces stated on paragraph 8. Skilled workers like physicians and craftsmen/women made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus, products, tools, and other useful things stated on paragraph 9.  There were people that needed to buy goods from artisians and traders. These were the merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public stated on paragraph 10.  At the bottom of the social structure were the slaves and farmers. Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. Being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles stated on paragraph 11. Farmers tended the fields. raised animals, kept canals, and reservoirs in good order, worked in stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could do as much as 60% of their yearly harvest stated on paragraph 12. Social mobility was not impossible. A small number of peasants and farmers moved up the economic ladder. Families saved money to send their sons to village schools to learn trades.  These schools were run by priests or by artisans. Boys who learned to read and write could become scribes, then go on a gain employment in the government stated on paragraph 13.  That is how the system of Ancient Egypt worked.

Aristotle believes that a good tragedy doesn't just show for the spectacle, but truly makes us feel for the characters, and incites those feelings of pity and fear.  As Aristotle states, ""It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear."" Aristotle also believes that another element of the ideal tragedy does not feature a turn from bad to good, but instead should feature the reverse and should go from good to bad. He believes that this turn should be brought about by a crucial mistake made by a character. The third element of an ideal tragedy is one with a single issue as its plot. Aristotle compares those with a ""double threat of plot"", like the Odyssey, as second rank. He believes that it is only considered the best because of the weakness of the audience.

During the first day alone, ""dramatic improvements to the efficiency, or orderliness, of the class"" (CommonLit Staff 1) could be observed. As students in Mr. Jones' class became more serious about the movement and began to participate in actions outside of the classroom for the movement, more students joined in. The article states that ""by the end of the day the movement had over 200 participants,"" (CommonLit Staff 3) when the class originated with only 30 students. Only 4 days into the experiment, Jones noticed that the students had become ""increasingly invovled in the project"" (CommonLit Staff 4), which prompted him to end the experiment. The students had showcased that they were willing to do potentially damaging things in the name of their cause. Jones' was worried that his experiment was slipping out of control due to this demonstration from the students. This experiment showed how willing the crowd is to follow the example of those around them, and how readily they will compromise their morals to show their support.

62742e454d12,39c16e,"A tragedy must have a good and quality plot. The plot is ""the soul"" of tragedy. A ""perfect tragedy"" should not be simple and straightforward nor too complicated, it should have depth and meaning. The plot of an ideal tragedy is a man that is neither good nor evil whose life falls apart because of a mistake. The tragedy must pass feelings of terror and commotion to the public, it should be highly emotional and precise. A tragedy also must have intimate language and actions that engage the readers and excite pity and fear. The language and actions bring different ambiances and excitement throughout. The language should be pleasant and easily understood by the audience. A tragedy must have true tragic endings and not resemble comedies. An example of a comedy, not a tragedy is when those who are enemies leave the stage as friends at the end, and no one kills or is killed. It is overused and cliché. A tragedy must have death, successes, losses, and different feelings so people can become engaged and feel the emotions. A tragedy has a dynamic spectrum of emotions that can be used differently across the board, but it is up to the writer to take those emotions and fit them with their desired storyline.",2.91429433872147,3.77556381837151,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

He starts out by describing actions, ""...excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (Artistole, 2). The meathod that the author should take, Artistole suggests, is one where actions of the characters promote feelings of remorse and a little bit of fear for the excitement. Another element Artistole believes is in an ideal tragedy is, ""the downfall of the utter villian be exhibited"" (Artistole, 2). Connecting this to Hamlet, this means that if Claudius is the villian, he shouldn't die because it would cause the audience to think of it as misfourtune. Finally, the third ideal trait that a true tragedy should posess is, ""some great error or frailty, in a chracter"" (Artistole, 3). This ultimatly means that the main character, the protagonist, shall do something utterly stupid that worsens his own life. This truly would be depressing as the audience would want to see the protagonist grow in his life which goes from bad to good instead of good to bad.

f5154ae8d89c,39c16e,"The first element of an ideal tragedy is that there should be a complex plan rather than a simple plan. According to the text, Aristotle states that ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (para 2). This would mean that an ideal tragedy would essentially evoke extreme emotions, like pity or fear from the audience, but not merely indicate a change in fortune of a person from good to bad that does not cause any significant reaction from the audience. The second element of a tragedy, as mentioned, there should be a reversal in fate going from good to bad and not from bad to good. An additional detail should include the idea that the misfortune causing a person to go from ""prosperity to adversity"" (para 2) should be ""unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like oursleves"" (para 2). This means that the misfortune should be in a manner that the person suffering the misfortune does not necessarily deserve it. Only then is it thought that pity or fear will be evoked to be considered as an ideal or effective tragedy. The third element of an ideal tragedy is the misfotrune coming about due to ""some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse"" (para 3). This would mean that there should be some error either caused by the person receiving the misfortune or by the part of some surrounding error. As a result, the error should lead to the misfortune as a whole and in turn evoke fear and pity from the audience.

One of these elements include imitating actions which excite pity and fear. It says this in paragraph 2,  ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"". Another element is that it should be arranged on the complex plan rather than the simple plan. It states this in paragraph 2, ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan"". The last element of an ideal tragedy is that it should have a well constructed plot that is single in its issue. It says this in paragraph 3, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain"". Aristotle liked to invoke human emotion in his writings and one of the ways he did this was by including these elements in his works.

8f26ead60b4e,39c16e,"Throughout Chapter 13, Aristotle proclaims three elements of an ideal tragedy must be the virtuous character, the flaws within that character's personality, and the shift of ending into one of misfortune.  Aristotle overall scopes the plot of perfect tragedy by revealing that the  character must be one of prestige. In his efforts to indicate this claim, he incorporates the examples of  Oediupus and Thyestes. In doing this, Aristotle indicates that one of the key features of an ideal tragedy involves an individual that is highly prosperous in order to drive his plot even further. The second element expressed is the trait within a character that allows for a downfall. Aristotle also used Oedipus, Orestes, and other tragic heroes from mythology in order to heavily emphasize that the flaw in the personality. Aristotle mentions that this error in one's character should be due to misjudgment or frailty. Evidently, all these elements influence the overall idea he expressed that to a perfect tragedy an individual must experience a downfall or a reversal of misfortune. He uses the previous two elements in order to enhance this idea by affirming that from being a prosperous individual, the character's flaws will allow him to plunder into a downfall and lose the  fortune they possess.",3.02080316987911,2.42119950312023,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

eb76bd210a89,39c16e,"One element of an ideal tragedy, as summarized by Aristotle, is that there should be a serious change in circumstances of the main character, specifically a change from good circumstances to bad, instead of bad to good. Aristotle says ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad."" Aristotle argues that if the fortune changed from bad to good, then it wouldn't invoke any feelings of pity in us, as it wouldn't be considered a tragedy if a character's fortune increased throughout the play, as this would be a good thing. Aristotle also says a good tragedy should portray a character who is somewhere in the middle between being inherently good and inherently bad. He says ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes - that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty."" Essentially, Aristotle is saying that the main character shouldn't be too good, as this wouldn't invoke any pity, however, the character also shouldn't be too evil, or else the audience wouldn't feel sorry for him and his bad misfortune. Lastly, Aristotle says a good tragedy should exhibit a character experiencing misfortune due to a flaw in his character, not necessarily because of bad or immoral behaviror. He says ""It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse."" Overall, Aristotle argues that a good tragedy should portray a character who is neither good nor bad, but rather somewhere in the middle, who experiences a change of fortune from good to bad due to some inherent flaw of his character.

d2c5d7ab3ef7,39c16e,"As Aristotle states, there are many key elements to a tragedy. Aristotle claims that without these key elements, the work can not be considered a tragedy. These elements shape how the plot should look, and what the characters should act like. The first of these elements is a complex plan that arouses both pity and fear. Another key element that relates to this, is how the story should not be morally satisfying. This would make the story irregular and make it even more ""sad"" for a reader. Characters also need to be specific to produce a good tragedy, the main character must start in a high, well regarded position and take a massive fall into a more depressing state.

317049794171,3b9047,"The ancient Egyptian system of government was structured like a pyramid.  Different social classes were involved and went down the stack like this: Pharaohs, nobles/priests, and farmers/slaves. According to the text, ""Their leaders, called pharaohs, were believed to be gods in human form."" This perfectly explains why pharaohs were at the top of the pyramid because the text also says the following: ""Egyptians believed that the gods controlled the universe. Therefore, it was important to keep them happy."" What better way to make somebody happy than making them rich and powerful? The next rung on the ladder was the one held by nobles and priests, however, these were not much lower than the pharaohs. Quote: ""Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions, they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods.""  This clearly shows that while below pharaohs, nobles and priests were still majorly important in Egyptian culture. Next were physicians and craftsmen. Quoted here, ""Skilled workers such as physicians and craftsmen/women made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things."" The middle class was still needed and wanted, unlike the bottom of the pyramid, which was farmers and slaves. As I quote here, ""At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers. Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles."" Also, ""Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest—that’s a lot of hay!""

The pharoh is the leader of the area and was beleived to be human gods, the pharoh had responsibilities like protecting Egypt.  In the third paragraph, it states "" Their leaders, called pharaohs, were believed to be gods in human form. ""  This qoute explains the Egyptians beliefs and why the pharohs were leaders.   The second highest, were the powerful nobles and priets.  The nobles held the goverment posts, while the priests were responsible with pleasing the gods.  In the sixth paragraph, it sites that ""Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods.""  This qoute explains what the preists and nobles did and it shows their importance.  Physicians and craftsmen/women were in the middle class.  They made and sold jewerly, pottery, papyrus products and some other useful and wanted objects.  In paragraph nine it states that ""Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things.""  This helps explain their job which is why they were in  the middle class.  Below the middle class is the merchants and storekeepers.  Their job was selling goods the the public.  In the tenth paragraph, the author states that ""These were the merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public.""  This qoute helps explain what their jobs were,  In the bottom class,  they had the slaves and farmers.  The slaves jobs were to follow orders, work on building projects.  In the eleventh paragraph, it states that "" Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles.""  This qoute helps explain my answer because it states what work slaves had to do.  The farmers job was to tend fields, raise animals, kept canals, and more.  In the twelveth paragraph, the author mentions that ""Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest—that’s a lot of hay!""  This qoute helps explain my answer because it explains what the farmers do for a living.

888abfac4dc6,39c16e,"As described by Aristotle, one element of an ideal tragedy is one that effectively voices it plot through a single lense from which is complex and venturing out into different perspectives instead of and rather than being clear and concise and simplistic to a certain degree. This is supported within the passage in paragraph 2 where it states, ""A perfect tragedy should...be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan."" This quote by Aristotle is comprehending the purpose of the passage to build up the ideal tragedy, and to make the experience for the audience more interesting and worth-while to bring about analogies and comparison on the greatness of tragedies, in general. Another element of an ideal tragedy, according to Aristotle, is the use of pity and fear through imitation of certain actions from which  is a persuasive technique used to bring in the audience for more and feel compassion for the main character being affected at hand. Evidence from the text to support this statement is near the beginning of paragraph 2 where it states, ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" From this expression by Aristotle, we can sense the urgence of pity and fear to the makeup of a tragedy and from which, in line, feeds into the different objectives of a tragedy and what makes a tragedy ideal to Greek playwrights. Last, but not least, the third element of an ideal tragedy mentioned is to have a tragedy that is of a single reference and reasoning from which is the result of misassumed and misfortunate actions rather than of actual bad influence and illicit actions, as seen within paragraph 3 where it states, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double...[i]t should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty.""",3.02165289861063,2.37902381901034,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

1ec6c7f88443,39c16e,"           Aristotle believes there are certain elements that come together to produce an ideal tragedy. He believes the character who commits the tragic flaw should be a fair character who is well known, and should be not a great nor terrible person. For example, in Romeo and Juliet, Romeo isn't a villian or an amazing person, but rather a typical teenage boy more than anything else.  In addition, Aristotle believes the tragic flaw should not occur due to immoral behavior by the character, but rather by an error or a mistake. For example, Romeo's tragic flaw came through his impulsive decision to marry Juliet, which wasn't a terrible, immoral act. Lastly, the plot of a tragedy should consist of a good to bad change of fortune. In the beginning of the tragedy, the character should experience something good, but his/her's fortune should turn to something bad towards the end. Overall, the ideas of a neither good nor bad character, an underserving misfortune, and a flow of a good to bad fortune are three of Aristotle's many elements of an ideal tragedy.

0271baf2b78f,39c16e,"One main element of an ideal tragedy is that of a single unified plot.  This means that the story follows the actions and resolution of the main character only, and focuses on the character's change of fortune froom good to bad. Another element most crucial to a tragedy is that the plot must incite both fear and pity for all who watch the play. If the play ends with a ""feel good"" moment, then it has failed as a tragedy, as it doesn't incite fear and pity. The purpose of tragedy is not to  satisfy some moral sense, but to inspire feelings appropriate to witnessing a tragedy, to experience a ""cleansing"" of watching someone else suffer.  Lastly, an ideal tragedy must have a protagonist that is not overly righteous or holy, but is not depraved; the character is somewhat middle of the road.  By having the character behave in this way it makes the story more realistic and true, making the character's journey that much more engaging for the audience.  When the audience sees a tragic event occur to a plausible character because of a mistake or slight misfortune, the feeling of tragedy is heightened because it seems more true.",3.34823182563613,3.51775345440415,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

b56a64659f84,39c16e,"Aristotle explains, ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."". By this, he means that a tragedy should make the audience feel a lot of different emotions but mostly pity and fear. They should pity the main character but also fear them because they will eventually become bad. Another element he highlights is a lapse in judgment, he writes, ""— that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity,5 but by some error of judgment or frailty."". One man cannot be good nor bad but simply make a mistake. A good tragedy is when the man is just a normal person who takes the wrong turn or makes a deadly mistake that results in a series of alarming events. The final element he discusses is an unhappy ending.  Aristotle explains, ""many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending."". Tragedies should end unhappily. The essence of a tragedy is not to get a happy ending or to have everything resolved it is just simply to end.

73be2d239021,39c16e,"One element of an ideal tragedy, according to Aristotle, is that the change of fortune of the main character should not go from bad to good, but instead, good to bad. He believes that the plays that have a bad ending for the main character are the most tragic in effect. Another element Aristotle thinks is important is having a main character that is not either a full-on villain or completely virtuous. This is because he thinks the downfall of a viruous man would simply shock the audience, while the downfall of a villain would satisfy the morals of the audience, but not cause them to feel pity or fear. The last element is that the main character's turn of fate shouldn't be brought about by immoral behavior, but instead by a great error or frailty. If a man's turn of fate was brought about through purely immoral reasons, the audience might think that he deserves it and not feel any pity for him.",2.69021867138233,0.948114324675329,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

Only nobles could hold government posts, in the social pyramid, they were right below the pharaoh (along with priests). They profited from tributes in these positions. Nobles had great status and grew very wealthy from the donations to the gods (Noble Aims Section). Soldiers fought in wars or put an end to domestic uprisings. They also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved with building structures like pyramids and palaces during long periods of time. Physicians and craftsmen and woman made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and much more. Merchants and storekeepers would sell these goods to the people (Soldier On Section). Now on the bottom of the social pyramid (or social structure as it is called in the article), slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. They were forced to work on building projects. They also worked extremely hard at the discretion of the pharoh or nobles. Wanting to change your social status was impossible to do. A very tiny number of peasants and farmers did go up in the economic ladder. Schools were ran by priests and artisans. Boys who could read and write would become scribes and would go into working for the government (The Bottom Of The Heap Section).

However, this was a lot of work, so the Pharaoh had government official. There was nobles and priests. The priests would do jobs that had relation to the Gods. Nobles were the only ones who could hold government posts. However, there was also the vizier, who ensured that taxes were collected, and scribes, who kept government records. They also had soldiers, who would supervise the peasents, farmers, and slaves. There was  skilled workers aswell, such as physicans or craftmen/craftswomen, who made many types of goods, such as jewelry, pottery, papyrus, and other things. At the bottom of the social Pyramids were slaves and farmers. Salvery happenned when someone was captured as prisoners of war. Farmers tended to the feilds, kept canals and reserviors, and raised animals, and more. Their taxes were payed and kept in case of a famish, so they were actually very important.

46bdbaace78f,ebad26,"With the help of Sinclar and Jonas, the shameful conditions that once occurred in Chicago's meatpacking industry had been caught. Specifically, Sinclar reveals the immoral actions that transpired in an attempt to cover up spoiled meat.  Sinclar indicates that the factories covered up spoiled meat through masking odors, reusing rejected meat, and combining normal meat and rat meat simply out of pure laziness. For example, Sinclar states that the meat ""would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption."" That quote in itself explains one of the many attempts in which the factories hid their corrupt techniques. Additionally, Sinclar incorporates vivid and descriptive imagery to illustrate the masked meatpacking process. Sinclar states, ""There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms, and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it. It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats."" The explanation regarding the rats and the leaky rooms emphasizes the feeble conditions located in the specific offices. Another way in which the factory workers hid their spoiled meat was by supplementing odorous pickles to the most spoiled portions of meat. This was done in an attempt to mask the stench of the meat. Overall, Sinclar uses tone and imagery to illustrate the corrupt business done by meatpacking workers.

574369ff8f20,39c16e,"An ideal tragedy must have a relateable hero, a singular plot, and a plot where the hero's own human flaws cause their demise. This is exemplified by Aristotle's description of the ideal tragic hero. Paragraph 2 states, ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families."" It's imperative to understand that the protagonist of a Greek tragedy and their qualities are some of the defining traits of a tragedy. The protagonist has to speak to a common humanity within the audience in order to have maximum emotional appeal and impact.  The audience will only be distressed at the events the hero is subject to if they can cry with him and relate  to them just like any person. If the protagonist is either someone incredibly saint-like that never makes mistakes that result in conflict or outrageously and comedically evil that succeeds because of their malevolence, the audience will not be able to see themselves in the hero because such drastic personalities or situations rarely happen in real life. Because the fundamental plot elements seem fantastical, the audiene will feel more removed from the play and will not feel the pain as the hero feels it when they fail, or the triumphance when they succeed. The best way to make a hero human to the audience is to give them nuance. Like most people, the tragic hero should generally strive to do good but get caught up by their own mistakes like pride, anger, lack of judgement, etc. so that they aren't bad people but still accountable for their mistakes. It's essential to make tragic heroes essentially common men that the audience already identifies with (such as honorable nobility who are still humans without any special or divine powers) who have relateable motivations and qualities that cause them to fail due to their own actions while still being sympathetic people. Since this reminds the audience of themselves, it will feel all the more tragic when they suffer, which is the point of the tragic play. In order to have the optimal amount of misery, the plot should be singular. This is discussed in paragraphs 3 and 4, which state, ""He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families. ...In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. Like the Odyssey, it has a double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the good and for the bad. ...It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies — like Orestes and Aegisthus — quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain."" This text demonstrates how one single serious plot is necessary for a proper tragic play. A true tragedy must have the complex protagonist endure general failure as well as the associated physical and emotional pain due to their own incorrect actions, and this should be the only plot point in the play to prevent distractions. On the other hand, double plots  often resolve positively without events like major character death or conflict. The idea that the protagonist does not have to endure any of the consequences of their actions and suffer as a result is the complete antithesis of a tragedy. As a result, the audience does not reach catharsis because there are no emotional stakes if everything is fixed by the end. Therefore, they have no lasting negative emotions pertaining to the play.",3.36999122260667,3.89794064266612,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

The very top of the pyramid was the gods and the pharaohs because the gods controlled the universe and because the pharaohs were believed to be able to comunicate with the gods so they were thought as god like. The gods controlled the universe and the pharaohs controlled everyone. The priest and nobles were next. Only nobles could hold government office. The priest were supposed to make the gods happy. After nobles and priest came the soldiers. The soldiers were the ones that fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings. Soldiers were also the ones who supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces. The people who were next after soilders were scribes. A scribe recorded in writing the everyday life and extraordinary happenings in ancient Egypt. Their jobs were varied and included writing letters for fellow villagers who couldn't write, recording the amount of crops harvested. After the scribes came the merchants. Egyptian merchants carried products such as gold, papyrus made into writing paper or twisted into rope, linen cloth, and jewelry to other countries. Next after merchants were artisans. Artisans created the fine artwork that often covered temples, royal tombs, and other monuments. They worked in large groups to complete engravings, paintings, and hieroglyphics. Despite artisans' skill and creativity, the upper classes often viewed them as little more than common laborers. Next after artisans were farmers. Now we're on to the lower part of the pyrimad with farmers. Farmers are the ones who harvest food. They also harvest papyrus for others(most likely scribes) to write on. Now we're on the VERY bottom of the social pyrimad with slaves and servants. The servants worked as cooks, butlers, litter carriers, and as pharaoh's dressers. The male servants also worked on royal building projects or were sent to fight in the Egyptian army. Egyptian servants did not have many rights but were usually not treated poorly. Egyptian servants could not own or inherit land. Slaves were very important in ancient Egypt as a big part of the labor force, but they were also used for many other purposes. Many slaves were house servants, gardeners, farm labor, musicians and dancers of excellent talent, scribes, and accountants.",3.80272207089915,3.51483103434524,"In complete sentences, summarize the structure of the ancient Egyptian system of government.

66db2c282419,39c16e," Three elements of an ideal tragedy that are described by Aristotle are plot, character, and diction. Plot should give a single issue and not double and should be from good to bad in terms of change of fortune. The fortune should come as a result of error in a character from better to worse and imitate pity and fear. Character should be defiant of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity from the spirit of Tragedy and possess no tragic qualities and related to the audience to create emotions. Diction or choice of words should be arranged in a simple, but complex plan and imitate actions of pity and fear, while also thoroughly satisifing moral sense and well-being. Evidence to support these statements are in paragraphs 2 and 3 where it reads, "" A plot of this kind would, doubtless, satisfy the moral sense, but it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves...A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse... the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty...A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity."" These pieces of evidence further support my assertion of the three main elements of an ideal tragedy being plot, character, and diction by showing the importance of a plot and its significance of portraying pity and fear and character and its importance of showing one's personality to be from adversity to prosperity, while showing the significance of diction and its well-being of providing a sense of pity and fear and satisying moral sense throughout the play and tragedy in its choice of words.",1.98471716382454,2.54906922938127,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

8d9cd2ec20cb,39c16e,"Three elements of an ideal tragedy as described by Aristotle are a well constructed plot, a character's soul, as well as the production/performance. The most important element of an ideal tragedy is based off of the plot. Aristotle says that, "" The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad,"" (Aristotle, 3). The outcome of the main character will have come from some sort of great error or frailty, the ideal tragic hero should be an all good man with a very minor flaw in his character, and the entire tragedy should be continued upon this judgement. Aristotle also explains how a the plot should be a very complex plan where the actions of the characters exemplify emotions such as pity and fear with the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. He suggests that the best sorts of a tragedy are the complex plots that arouse both pity and fear. He then explains how a good plot must avoid a hero becomming miserable, avoid the transition from misery to happiness for an the antagonist, and also avoid the antagonist to feel happiness and leading into one's misery. He simply just believes that the best plot derives from the mistrtune of someone and whose future downfall leads to an error in judgement. The second element includes the character's actions and personality. To Aristotle, the character must be set up for failure even though this character has the personality of a ""good character."" The show , ""follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear; it merely shocks us. Nor, again, that of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity: for nothing can be more alien to the spirit of Tragedy; it possesses no single tragic quality; it neither satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear,"" (Aristotle, 2).  Meaning this, the overall sense and focus of the play should not be based on the hero losing his ""good."" Instead, the character must make multiple judgements and go through an entire storyline, not aware of the downfall set right for him. The final element of an ideal tragedy is the spectacle and production itself. Although Aristotle does not go fully into the details regarding this element, in paragraph 3, it is noted that "" A tragedy, then, to be perfect according to the rules of art, should be of this construction....because he follows this principle in his plays, many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending. The best proof is that on the stage and in dramatic competition, such plays, if well worked out, are the most tragic in effect"" (Aristotle, 3). Rather than explaining the scenic visuals of the play and visual effects of a ""spectacle,"" Aristotle explains that the true spectacle is the dramatic competition and the tragedy in effect. The best endings is one that is unhappy and shocks the audience.

5319cec5a6d6,39c16e,"Aristotle made clear many elements that need to be present to construct an ideal tragedy. Though he stresses many ideas, they all fall into general elements that must be included, which includes the actions must spark pity and fear, the change in fortune should be from good to bad, and this shift shouldn't be due to one's bad habits rather from an error of judgment or frailty. Aristotle wrote, ""it should moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (2). He not only states that it should create the feeling of pity and fear, but also states that these two feelings are distinctive marks of tragedies. This helps to explain why he stresses how the story should change, ""not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad"" (3). Tragedies are supposed to be sad and make the reader feel bad for the character which a story from good to bad does, while a story from bad to good  expresses the feeling of achievement and reshapes for the better. Lastly he describes the element of how misfortune is not brought by, ""Vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty""(2). He said the character can't be a villain because this wouldn't be a tragedy and the person couldn't be someone known for being good. It must be a renowned and prosperous person whose misfortune happens because he makes a wrong judgment or bad choice instead of something they have always done like a habit. Aristotle made the elements of tragedy, expressing pity and fear, making sure it was good to bad, and that it wasn't a normal error of the person rather bad judgment, clear through his writing.",3.6262817507338,2.20429441467864,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

In the pickling of hams they had an ingenious apparatus, by which they saved time and increased the capacity of the plant—a machine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by plunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds. And yet, in spite of this, there would be hams found spoiled, some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them. To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor—a process known to the workers as “giving them thirty per cent.” Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be found some that had gone to the bad. Formerly these had been sold as “Number Three Grade,” but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron. After this invention there was no longer Number One, Two, and Three Grade—there was only Number One Grade. The packers were always originating such schemes—they had what they called “boneless hams,” which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and “California hams,” which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out; and fancy “skinned hams,” which were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no one would buy them—that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled “head cheese!”",-0.948170540387722,-1.70783541227995,Summarize the various ways the factory would use or cover up spoiled meat.

25e459261b79,39c16e,"Aristotle was one the smartest philosopher's at this time and had many opinions on how a tragedy should be written. Firstly,  Aristotle believed that a plot should be complicated rather than simple. The text states ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan"" (Aristotle). This quote shows how he believes a complicated plot is a necessity for tragedy. Aristotle  also believed that a tragedy should cause pity and fear in the audience. in paragraph 2, the text states, "" It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (Aristotle). This once again brings up the topic of catharsis otherwise known as emotional release. Aristotle believes that a true tragedy should make the audience feel pity and frightened and be able to release these emotions because of the show. Aristotle also believed that the characters should be relatable to invoke this fear into the people. The text states, ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity"" (Aristotle). This explains how a charcter that is morally grey, as most humans are, will be more relatable and make the audience feel pity. They will also be scared, because they do not want this to happen to themselves. Lastly,  Aristotle believes that these plays should end tragically or else it is second tiered.  The article states "" The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure. It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies — like Orestes and Aegisthus — quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain"" (Aristotle). In this he is explaining that without the unhappy ending, it doesnt not give the audience 'true tragic pleasure'. This is what Aristotle charcterized Greek tragedies by during his time as a philosopher.",3.49673982824454,3.60844082805949,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

f53c3a08ba01,ebad26,"In the meatpacking industry, the workers would use certain methods, such as taking the bones out of rotten ham or pickling the ham to reduce the odor.  Sinclair states that ""some ingenious person had hit upon a new device"" where they would ""extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay"" in order to get rid of grades for the meats (Sinclair 2). Even though a bad part of the meat was being extracted, the way it was done was still unsanitary and it was used as a scheme by the meatpacking industry to appeal to the greater population. The meatpacking industry found another way to increase productivity by ""fill[ing] a ham with pickle in a few seconds"" through the process of using a ""needle into the meat and working with his foot"" in order to make the meat last longer, even at the cost of ruining its sanitation (Sinclair 2). The fact that the workers would use their feet in the process indicated how the meatpacking industry was corrupt when it came to providing sanitary ham's to the population and that it would find any way possible to increase productivity and cover-up spoiled meat.

Aristotle  believes that the goal of a tragedy is to ""imitate actions which excite pity and fear"" and argues that in order for the tragedy to accomplish this goal, it should feature the downfall of a hero ""who is neiter eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought on not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty."" He thinks that if the hero were purely good, his downfall would simply be shocking to the audience, whereas the downfall of a purely evil man would not arouse pity or fear, since ""pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves"" and the audience would instead derive moral satisfaction from seeing the evil man get what he deserved. Finally, Aristotle writes that while a tragedy should ""be arranged not only the simple but on the complex plan"" but that there should not be a ""double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the good and bad"" because in that case the sense of pleasure from the audience will not be ""true tragic pleasure"" but closer to what the audience would feel when watching a comedy.",3.90032610436019,0.556479831902046,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

1acf92125772,39c16e,"Three of the main elements of a great tragedy are as follows: actions that incite pity and fear, a change of fortune from good to bad, and the exclusion of the utter downfall of the villian. Aritsotle explains that the feeling of pity and fear is ""the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (2). In order for one to incite those feelings from an audience, someone who is neither fully good, nor bad, has to befall a misfortune. This misfortune has to come from a good place and change circumstances for the worse. ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty..."" (Aristotle 3). This means that in order to have a good tradegy, one must have a main character make a costly mistake that causes them great hardship. The last element of a good tragedy is the avoidance of the utter downfall of a villain, because, according to Aristotle, ""...it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves"" (2). And as stated earlier, pity and fear are one of the most necessary components to an ideal tragedy, so if villian dies a horrible death, the story won't have the necessary components. If that story has these three main elements - pity and fear, misfortune, and the avoidance of the downfall of a villian, it would make a great tragedy.",2.80301320236021,1.58900654208131,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

People are drawn more to tradegys that they feel a connection to. Another major element I believe makes an ideal tragedy is making it serious enough where the audience can feel the words. Turning a tradgey into a funny comegdy is not something people run towards. Most people want to know that how they feel is what others feel as well. If it is shown the way it is to be felt; not twisted to make it funny or less serious that people will be drawn to it more. One last element that I believe makes an Ideal tragedy is someone who is doing well and maybe is prospering has a big downfall. A tradgedy like that shows that fortune can have its tradegys too. ,1.16091187058755,1.16598048415761,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

He then goes on to show explain how an author can initiate these feelings in the audiance through specific characters and their mistfourtunes. Aristotle also goes on to say that the protagonist in a tragedy should not be someone who is perfect and saint-like, but it also should not be someone who is evil. He says, ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes-that of a man who is not emminently good and just, yet whose mistfourtune is brough about not by vice,"" (Paragraph 2).  The final element that, accodring to Aristotle, makes an ideal tragegy is the change of fourtune. He says, ""the change of fourtune should not be from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad,"" (Paragraph 3).

They had control over all their subjects and citizens. They usually were built pyramids for their tombs. Under the Pharoah was a minister or vizier. The vizier's job was to collect taxes and to make sure everyone paid them.  Scribes worked with the vizier because they held government records. Scribes were important because they could read and write.  Then there were nobles and priests. Priests would feed and please the gods to make them happy.  Nobles would hold government posts and they profited from the gifts. There were also soldiers who would fight in wars. And workers such as craftsmen and women and physicians.

102c9b9dad7c,39c16e,"Three elements that make a tragedy ideal include being based on a complex plan,  a highly prosperous, average main character, and an unmerited issue. Aristotle writes that ""A perfect tragedy...not on the simple but on the complex plan."" This shows that a good tragedy must be complex if it is to rise above others. Aristotle also writes ""...a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about...by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned..."" This proves that Aristotle believes that the main character of a great tragedy must be a man who is neither good nor evil, but somewhere in between; and that that man must be prosperous or renowned. Finally, Aristotle states ""...pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves."" Therefore, if a tragedy were to display a man such as one described above, and have a random, unforeseen misfortune befall him, the audiences would easily be able to relate. In the world, no one knows what fate has in store, and this specific setting easily allows audience members to imagine themselves as the main character.

Aristotle emphasizes the idea that there must be an unforeseen misfortune in a great disaster, from good to poor, not bad to good. The audience is moved by this abrupt change of fortune as it creates a sense of pity and concern for the characters. He also assumed that the character would endure a fall due to their own error of judgement in an ideal tragedy. As it should be ""brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty."" By this approach, the text represented it as being able to alter the audience's perception of the personality and behavior of the character. Aristotle also believes that the main character should have ""highly renowned and prosperous"" qualities and characteristics of virtue.

Baking soda would be used on the meat to eliminate the terrible odor of the spoiled meat. The factory would also inject a pickle which would eliminate the smell of the hams as well. The author states, ""To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor- a process known to the workers as 'giving them thirty-percent' "" (Sinclair 3). A needle filled with stronger pickle, compared to the pickle they used on freshmeat, would be injected to the ham.

11c3509b7b43,814d6b,"The Third Wave developed over such a short period of time because of how seriously the students reacted to the regime of the Third Wave. After the reading explains what rules were outlined to students, the text states, ""As the week went on, Jones’ class transformed into a group with a supreme sense of discipline and community.  [...] This resulted in dramatic improvements to the efficiency, or orderliness, of the class. [...] After only three days, the experiment took on a life of its own, with students from all over the school joining in. The class expanded from initial 30 students to 43 attendees"" (CommonLit). This cluster of text qoutes shows how legitamately the student took directions because the students did not even hesitate to follow orders nor did they question the ethics of some of the rules. For example, not a single student questioned the morals of the salute when it was purposefully intended to resemble that of the Nazi regime's salute. This not only proves how naive minor's can be to their superiors but also demonstrates how quickly society can follow one another when the majority is commiting said action. This is the classic case that everyone and their neighboor's mom told you as a kid: ""If your friend jumped off a bridge would you jump too?""- in this case and many, yes, you would be more likely to commit an action, even if it may be questionable, if your peers are also participating in the action. This fact connects back not only many examples throughout human history but in varying life forms across the globe. Birds for example learn to fly, walk, eat, etc. by watching their siblings and following the mother. It is human nature to follow the pack and unfortunately it is not always a benefit to society.

d5a135e55d4d,3b9047,"The base starts with farmers and slaves. The economical positions rise as they go up. At the very top point of the pyramid are the gods. Here is the order from greatest to least: Egyptian Gods/Pharaohs,  nobles/priests, soldiers, craftmen/traders, and lastly farmers/slaves. The gods are at the highest position in status. They have the right to overpower everyone. Also, since everyone praises them they believe that the gods were responsible of many things as well. Like safety. Sometimes the pharaohs direct the army or create laws. As stated in the text, ""They had absolute power over their subjects...The pharaoh directed the army in case of a foreign threat or an internal conflict. All the laws were enacted at the discretion of the pharaoh."" Because the pharaohs/gods couldn't do all the duties themselves they have assistants called viziers which are chief ministers. They have the duty of collecting taxes from people like farmers. According to the article, ""No single person could manage all these duties without assistance. The pharaoh appointed a chief minister called a vizier as a supervisor. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected."" Called a ""chain of command"" the viziers have assistants as well.  They are called scribes; they are the only ones who can read and write. Now under the whole chain of gods/pharaohs there are the nobles/priests. According to the text, the only people who can develop government posts are the nobles. And priests' duties are to keep the gods satisfied. Like said in the text, ""Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods."" Also, the nobles grow very wealthy from recieving all the gifts of the gods from the subjects. Next are the soldiers. The soldiers fight in wars or end ""domestic uprisings."" Also, they sometimes keep an eye on farmers, peasants, and slaves. As said in the article, ""Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings. During long periods of peace, soldiers also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces."" Next comes the middle class which is made up of skilled people life artisans, craftmen/women, and physicians. The craftmen would create jewlery and other products and then sell them to make some money. They were known as the merchants and sorekeepers. ""Skilled workers such as physicians and craftsmen/women made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things. Naturally, there were people needed to buy goods from artisans and traders. These were the merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public."" And at the bottom/base are the farmers and slaves. The farmers has to raise animals, take care of the fields, conduct some tasks in the stone quarries, construct royal monuments, and are responsible to keep the reservoirs and canals in shape. They also have to pay 60% of their annual harvest towards tax. ""Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs  in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest—that’s a lot of hay!""  Although people can't raise their status, young boys can go to school to learn how to read/write and then can become scribes or can apply for employment in the government which would make their status rise. The slaves have to work on developing projects and put extreme effort at the disrection of the nobles or pharaohs. ""At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers.

Having one problem in a tragedy helps the audience focus on that one problem, and having to many of those can cause the audience to get side tracked easily or get lost on what is happening. A second element that aristotle thinks is important is that the story line should have the actor go from good to bad, and not bad to good. This can help the audience stay involved and not get bored through the story, and it also gives the audience to think aboutor be curious about while they are reading it. The third ans last strategy that Aristotle brings up is that ""It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frality, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse.""

74545d29969c,814d6b,"The Third Wave, a five-day experiment conducted by Ron Jones, was created for the history teacher to help his students understand how people in horrific historical events had followed the crowd in the wake of terrible things. He started the experiemnt small, by inviting students to join a movement title. 'The Third Wave"", which aimed to bring down democracy. The movement stared out small in his classroom, by having kids pratice proper seating and abide by strict rules with him as their leader. Jones noticed that as the week went on, students had ""a supreme sense of discipline and community"" (CommonLit Staff) and even followed the Nazi-like salute Jones had made up. By the third day, the movement had tons of students involved all of whom showed, ""a drastic improvment in academic skills and tremendous motivation"" (CommonLit Staff). All members were issued a member card and given a specific task/assignment to honor the movement. As members started to learn how to recruit more people, membership increased to over 200 students. They asked questions in three words or less and prefaced all their statments with ""Mr.Jones"". By the experiment's fourth day, Jones saw an alarming amount of loyalty and dedication to the movement. So much, that he knew he had to shut it down, before it got out of control. To reveal that the whole movement had been an experiment, Jones convinced his students that a presidential candidate of the nationally-recognized movement was publicly announcing it's existence on T.V., and ordered them all to a noon rally on Friday. When the students got to the rally, all they saw was a blank screen. Jones revealed that they had been part of an experiment to show how quickly people will join a group to prove their superiorety over others or have a sense of community no matter the type of community. He also explained how people will excuse any actions as contribution to the movement or classify it for ""the name of the state's honor"" (CommonLit Staff). He had to shut the experiment down because the movement was getting ot of control and people were involving themselves into something that they knew little about. As people started to gain a false sense of confidence in the movement, they excused weird and controlled behaviors in the name of the movement.

Aristotle writes, ""there remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty"" (2) explaining how when writing a tragedy one must follow a  balanced character who causes their own downfall through a relatable means. Additionally the ideal tragedy must ""imitate actions which excite pity and fear"" (2) so that the viewer both sympathizes with the character and fears that they too could suffer the same fate.

The second element which should be considered are the actions of the character and how they affect the plot. The plot should not have ahppy ending and lead to the 'villain' being defeated.  The characters in the story are important as well.

c028243a852d,39c16e,"According to Aristotle, there are three main elements to create an ideal tragedy within any story. The first main element for a tragedy to be ideal is for it to follow a complex plan and/or plot. The twists and turns of the storyline should not be easily predicted by the readers. Furthermore, the narrative the writer is trying to tell his audience should always end in leaving the readers and the character(s) unhappy. In relation to this element, the second main ingredient to create an ideal tragedy is to incite emotion from the readers, more specifically, pity and fear. Aristotle believes that the readers should not only see the pity and fear that the character is going through, but they should also feel it in an intense manner. Lastly, the third main element to creating an ideal tragedy according to Aristotle is to have a relatable and good character make a reasonable mistake. What Aristotle means from this is to have a character of goodness be brought down by a mistake that anyone could have made but is created to be blown out of proportion. An ""error of judgment or frailty,"" to be exact. This element is important because it creates further pity and fear for the readers to feel towards the character. Making the tragedy of the story much greater. ",3.14408917678279,3.42613276459037,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

The second element is having a character who is between two extremes, not extremely good and fair, but doesn't do immoral or evil actions to cause misfortune to himself. In paragraph two Aristotle states, ""...a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity..."" The third element is having actions ""which excite pity and fear."" Aristotle explains that we should avoid three types of plots which do not excite pity and fear. We should avoid a person going from prosperity to adversity, adversity to prosperity, and a bad man going from prosperity to adveristy because these plots do not not seem fearful or pitiable.",2.14122446550409,1.12377704516546,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

In paragraph 2 it also states, ""... some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them. To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle with destroyed the odor--a process known to the workers as 'giving them thirty percent'"" (Sinclair par.2). When the stench from the meat was bad enought workers would also use a machine to fill the meat with pickle to help rid of the odors. They would use much stronger pickle, and still end up selling the spoiled meat. In the end, the ways they would cover up the spoiled meat is by using baking soda, pickle, or chemistry to help rid of the odors to sell spoiled meat to consumers.

57d4aad66e97,39c16e,"    The ideal tragedy should include a multi-dimensional conflict, a neutral character's mistake, and that character's fortune turning from good to bad. A conflict that only has one tragic trait is not a tragedy, since it will not have enough dimension to provoke the emotions within an audience that are associated with tragedy, since this kind of conflict ""never satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear"" due to its basic nature (""On Tragedy""). Therefore, the writer(s)  should include multiple traits that build up to form the many different pillars that make a tragedy, since tragedies rarely occur because of a single tragic trait. To follow this conflict outline, the main character in a tragedy should be neither good nor bad, and their misfortune should occur due to a mistake that they've made. This is because ""pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves,"" meaning that it will be easier for the audience to feel pity and empathize with a character if they can see themselves in that character's shoes (""On Tragedy""). The character's fortune should also change from good to bad, since this will reflect the same pity in the audience that was aforementioned. When it comes down to why the target feeling is pity, that's because pity is the leading feeling that audiences have when reacting to tragedies. After all, tragedies are defined as ""great suffering, destruction, and distress,"" and these types of situations always have emotional consequences (Oxford Dictionary). If a tragedy is unsuccessful in provoking the emotions that come with tragedy, then it clearly would not be the ideal tragedy.

In Paragraph 1, the text states, ""For it was the custom, as they found, whenever meat was so spoiled that it could not be used for anything else, either to can it or else to chop it up into sausage."" Factories would manage to hide the spoiled food into sausage or in other cans of meat. However, the meat would leave a lingering, foul smell so more attempts to hide the use of spoiled meat were put into motion. Paragraph 2 includes, ""Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters; giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose."" The factories not only managed to cover the apperance of the spoiled meat but also the smell with attempts of rubbing soda on the pounds of food.

ee49145aa624,39c16e,"The Greek philosopher Aristotle described an ideal tragedy in literature in many defining aspects.  One of these is that a tragedy is complicated and heightens emotions such as remorse and fright as in the reader as the plot moves along.  Aristotle concludes, ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation.""  Due to this, Aristotle indicates how tragedies should be deeply thought out to provide an emotional experience in a reader.  Furthermore, a second aspect is how the changes throughout the plot will lead to a downfall of a character or event.  He demonstrates that the change should be ""not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad.""  Moreover, a third aspect of a tragedy is that the plot and storyline should follow one strict and sole storyline that will lead to the eventual negative outcome.  Aristotle suggests, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.""  To summarize, 3 elements of a tragedy from Aristotle are strong emotions stirring in a reader, the defeat of a major character or events in the plot, and one plotline that strictly follows the issue of this story until the tragic ending.",2.83495109138843,3.14321133114365,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

dfb33bc8ee43,39c16e,"Aristotle stated that the ideal tragedy needs to imitate human action in order to make the audience have pity or fear for a character. In order for this to happen, the tragedy must avoid certain roads that  can be considered predictable. An example of this would be a good person facing challenges or a bad person becoming prosperous. Another example would be making the downfall of the villain a big event that has no consequences. All three of this things, mainly due to their predictability, make it difficult for a viewer to invest their emotions into the tragedy. A good tragedy is also defined by a good character encountering evil, rather than a bad person growing and becoming better. Calling a play a tragedy certainly does not imply that a character will grow and become better.

4a7f0264c4e1,ebad26,"There were many ways the factory would use to hinder the condition of the spoiled meat. One of the various ways the factory would cover up spoiled meat was by rubbing the meat against soda to get rid of the odor. According to lines 19-21, ""also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose."" They used the chemistry in the method of rubbing the meat agains the soda to change the appearance and smell of the meat to make it more appetizing however, it hides the true condition of the meat.  Another way the factory covered up the spoiled meat was encorporating glycerin and borax from sausage rejected from Europe-suggesting the conditions of the spoiled meat were noticeable. According to paragraph 3 ""it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption."" Signyfying this was a repeated process to get the sausage accepted to other countries.  Furthermore, the factory would hide the spoiled meat by ""giving them thirty-percent"" which was done prior to finding hams spoiled from injection.  The text states ""Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be found some that had gone to the bad. Formerly these had been sold as “Number Three Grade,” but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron. After this invention there was no longer Number One, Two, and Three Grade—there was only Number One Grade."" This conveys that the factory narrowed down the techniques used to hinder the spoileld condition of the meat first done by intensyfing the amount of pickle to hide the smell to creating devices and apparatuses that extracted the ""bad parts"" (which created the condition) of the meat, in this case the bone. The new name for the meat being Number One Grade. These are the ways the factory was able to hide the state of the spoiled meat for selling.

If the story isn't complex then the story wouldn'tbe entertaining and enthralling to the reader. The story need to be long enough for the audience to understand the long suffering that the protagonist  goes through. The second element of a good tragety would the progress from good to bad fortune throughout the story.  A tragety isn't a tragety if the protagonist has a happy ending because it just isn't tragic. In order for the story to be tragic there needs to be a great amount of misery and woe involving the protagonist having the good things in life take from them throughout the span of the story. The third element of a good tragety is an unhappy ending. If the story ends happily for the protagonist then the story is not at all sad or tragic. We as people prefer to have a story end happily for the protagonist because it sits with us better. We prefer to walk away knowing that the main character got what they always wanted and that they found joy in the end.

8a72454de3e0,39c16e,"At least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle are having characters that the audience can relate to, a well constructed plot brought about by an error, and they follow a true tragic ending. When discussing a tragic character, Aristolte states that it is important to have a character that the audience can relate to. He does this when he says ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families."" He states that it is important to have a character with these traits because it arouses fear and pity in the audience. He states this throughout paragraph two when he says ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" In paragraph three, Aristotle begins to discuss the importance of plot. Aristotle states that the plot of a play should not be simple but not overly complex. He states this when he says ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain."" He then goes on to say that throughout the plot, the change of fortune should go from good to bad. In the last paragraph, Aristotle discusses true tragic endings and how some well know plays are mistaken for tragedies. Aristotle states that a second rank tragedy has a complex plot. He states this in the quote ""In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. "" He then moves on to say that these types of tragedies do not have true tragic ends. Aristotle states that a second rank tragedy ""is proper rather to Comedy"" and ends with ""those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies....quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain."" This takes away from a true tragedy because in the end, the protagonist must face their downfall.

1b82ce4967e9,39c16e,"One of the elements Aristotle claims is crucial to constructing an ideal tragedy is the emphasis on building a story out of pity and misfortune. As stated in paragraph 2, Aristotle remarks that "" It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" Aristotle is explaining how the best method of displaying tragedy in any poem is to put the main characters in a constant state of misfortune, which is meant to drive forward the narritive as it progresses. Next, Artistotle exclaims that the main character in a tragedy should never been considered ""good or bad"", but in between the two extremes. He claims in paragraph 2, ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity,  but by some error of judgement or frailty"". He emphasizes that the best way to craft a main character in a tragedy is not to witness a good man suffer from misfortune or a bad man pay for his crimes, but a simple man suffer for making mistakes that may be relatable to the reader themselves. Finally, Aristotle suggests that good tragedies must always involve particular families who have evil pasts. He explains this in paragraph 3 when he states, "" Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses — on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible."" This describes how building narratives based around icons of tragedies enhances the feelings of pity and misfortune when the main characters experince the tragedies themselves.",3.80272207089915,3.51483103434524,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

c3c5c24e2c62,39c16e,"    According to Aristotle, the ideal tragedy must evoke certain emotions, have a relatable main character, follow a specific plot, and have a particular ending. Early on, Aristotle establishes that the main point of a tragedy is to make the audience feel fear and pity, which requires a certain main character. This character must not be perfect or sinister. That would lead to the audience feeling little pity or fear. The audience would not be able to properly sympathize with this character due to most being somewhere in the middle of those extremes. Additionally, both the plot and ending to a tradegy must show a steep downward spiral regarding this character's life preferably due to human error. That way ,the audience will feel both pity and fear knowing they could have acted similarly. Anything else will not evoke the proper emotions. All in all, Aristotle finds that a lot goes into making the perfect tragedy, specifically having the right character, plot, ending, and emotions from the audience (Aristotle).

d2f114408f26,39c16e,"          Aristotle believed that the ideal tragedy should consist of the creation of pity and fear, a complex plan, and character that is subject to ""error of judgement."" The creation of pity and fear in the viewers is critical for a play because it is the ""distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" If it instead brings prosperity to adversity, the play doesn't invoke pity or fear and the result is just shock to the viewer, which is not the intention. A complex plot is also involved in an idealogical tragedy. Tragedies aim to be ""single in tissue, rather than double as maintain."" The plot should also not follow a storyline that goes from bad to good, but actually good to bad.  Lastly, character is another important aspect. Character is usually one that is considered to be a person who is good, but suffers misfortune and even their downfall due to their own judgement, making them very relatable. Usually they are also famous and prosperous, as seen with Oedipus and Thyestes. Therefore, pity and fear, complex plots, and character are all crucial to an idealogical tragedy.",3.06528267431314,3.56158114998884,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

Character was the two extremes or the tragic hero. in the story it says the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.

In paragraph one the author writes, ""For it was the custom, as they found, whenever mear was so spoiled that it could not be used for anything else, either to can it or else to chop it up into sausage."" This explains how they would put spoiled meat with fresh meat, instead of throwing the spoiled meat out. If the factory didn't put the spoiled meat in sausage, they would rub it with soda to take away the small, or they would use chemicals to enhance aspects of the meat. From paragraph two it states, ""...how the meat that was taken our of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose."" This explains there use of soda and chemicals to mask the spoiled meat. Next up, the factory would stuff ham with the spoiled meat using a machine and a needle. The text explains in paragraph two, ""... a cachine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by plunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds. And yet, in spite of this, there would be hams found spoiled..."" This evidence further describes how they would mask spoiled meat. Finally, once the factory discovered how to take the bone out of a ham, they would insert a white-hot iron, and they would go on to sell ""boneless hams"" or ""California hams"" and fancy ""skinned hams"" which all were filled with spoiled meat. However no one would buy skinned hams, until they were cooked, and chopped up fine, which they then called ""head cheese"". Evidence comes from paragraph two, ""...but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron. The packers were always originating such schemes—they had what they called “boneless hams,” which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and “California hams,” which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out; and fancy “skinned hams,” which were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no one would buy them—that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled “head cheese!” These lines of text explain the procedure that happened to the hams just for them to be sold.
