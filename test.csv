At the top was the pharaoh, of which was considered a god themself. They ruled over Egypt and  guided their people, though this came with many responsibilties. One of the biggest being, keeping their people safe and away from danger. Right below the Pharaoh on the social structure, were nobles and priests. Though, only nobles were able to hold government posts. Preists were responsible for pleasing the gods. The middle class was made up of skilled workers such as craftsmen/ women, and physicians. Craftsmen created and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus, products, tools, and many other items. There were also those who bought goods from artisans, such as merchants and storekeepers of which sold goods to the public.  Finally, at the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers. Those who were captured in war were made into slaves, and were also forced into working on building projects. However, farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and resivoirs in good order, and many other useful activities to help the upper classes.

6372b5b691b4,39c16e,"An ideal tragedy, according to Aristotle, must firstly ""satisfy the moral sense."" What this means is that a good and virtuous character (but not perfect) must suffer some kind of downfall. It can't be about a villian ""passing from adversity to prosperity,"" since that would not invoke the moral sense. Additionally, another requirement is that a tragedy must ""inspire pity and fear"".

Foremost, a tragedy should not solely appeal to human satisfication where the villain would blatantly receive a revenge of sorts. Instead, it should provoke a certain amount of pity and fear through ""unmerited misfortune (and) the misfortune of a man like ourselves (commonlit.org)."" Furthermore, the person to whom the tragedy is occurring to should neither be good or bad, and his life should fall apart through a mistake. Additionally, an ideal, well-constrcuted plot should include a singular, focused issue in which there is no complexity with two simultaneous problems.

Another element is that the tragedy itself should tantalize emotions such as pity and fear out of us, and not aim for merely shock value.  Another element he seems to jest to is that of it being relatable and in that same sense, it must be likeable, as a character that we don't relate to or like will not grasp out of the audience the proper reaction that is sought out.

Looking at this question of whether or not to use supplies to contaminate meat seems like a very simple answer. However, to the factory workers in the twentieth century, it was not. Not only was it not a simple answer there was no question.  ""There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it ... . It was too dark in these storage places to see well ... There was no place for the men to wash their hands before they ate their dinner"" (4-5) Sinclair goes on to explain that there was not an option for the workers, and the factory owners knew this.  They knew the workers needed the money to provide for their families.  To add to the atmosphere of the factories Sinclair says, ""With one member trimming beef in a cannery, and another working in a sausage factory, the family had a first-hand knowledge"" (1) The people were scared to step up for fear of backlash from their ""family"".

26e11646cf98,39c16e,"Aristotle describes many elements that should be included in a tragedy in On Tragedy. First, he believes that an ideal tragedy should have events that evoke pity or fear for the protagonist. He states this in paragraph two: ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" He goes on to explain how the audience will feel pity or fear- by portraying a protagonist who is not particularly good or evil, just an ordinary person who falls into misfortune. Second, Aristotle claims that a good tragedy should have a suitable plot that is not too complicated and in which the fortune turns from good to bad because of the characters' actions. He establishes this in the third paragraph: ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse. "" Finally, Aristotle highlights that the play should not be written based on what the audience wants- ""It is accounted the best because of the weakness of the spectators; for the poet is guided in what he writes by the wishes of his audience. The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure"". Those are three of the elements that Aristotle says should be in an ideal tragedy.",3.41164762595465,1.7486326808007,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse.""

The gods were at the top because the Egyptians believed that the gods controlled the world. In the text it states, ""Egyptians believed that the gods controlled the universe."" The quote from the text shows that the gods were in charge. Next, on the system of government was the pharoahs. The pharaohs had lots of power. The text says, ""Their leaders, called pharaohs, were believed to be gods in human form. They had absolute power over their subjects."" The quote shows that the pharoahs had a lot of controll. The pharaohs also directed the army in case of a conflict. According to the text, ""The pharaoh directed the army in case of a foreign threat or an internal conflict. "" The quote shows they had power. Then, below the pharoahs were the nobles and the priests.  The nobles held government posts, and the priests were responsible for pleasing gods. In the text it says, ""Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods."" Next, were the vizers. The vizers ensured that all taxes were collected. The text says, ""The pharaoh appointed a chief minister called a vizier as a supervisor. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected."" The quote above shows that the vizers had to make sure everyone paid their taxes.Also, the scribes worked with the vizers. The scribes kept government records. They could also read and write. In the text is says, ""Working with the vizier were scribes who kept government records. These high-level employees had mastered a rare skill in ancient Egypt — they could read and write."" This shows that they had an important skill and job. At the bottom of the structure were slaves and farmers. Slaves were forced to work on building projects. The slaves had to do hard labor. The farmers worked on the fields, raised aimals, kept canals and reservoirs in good shape, and much more. To prove that, the text states, ""Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles. Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments."" Farmers also paid taxes that could take away as much as 60% of their yearly-harvest.

686d9ba7cdf6,39c16e,"   An ideal tragedy follows a relatable protagnist. This character is flawed and down to earth in order for the audience to truly empathize with the hero's fatal flaw and sympathize with their great downfall. The plot of the story should follow the hero's fall from grace as a result of their behavior and the advancement of a heinous villain. The protagonist begins the story with good luck, then ends it with bad luck (and vice versa, in the antagonist's case). The most vital aspect of a tragedy is its ending. Tragedies must end unhappily. The hero must suffer a horrible ending and the villain is encouraged to prosper (or at least to win). This is to arouse deep seated feelings of fear and pity in the audience, feelings that they are usually disconnected with and tragedies were created to help the audience regulate their (often repressed) negativity by connecting with and learning from the protagonist's fate.

They were believed to be gods and had many responsibilities, protection is most important. A Pharaoh's assistant is a vizier, viziers made sure taxes were collected and they worked with scribes to keep the government records, they could also read and write. Right below the Pharoah were nobles and priests. Nobles held government posts and profited from tributes. Priests pleased the gods. Right before the lowest portion of the pyramid are the craftsman, physicians, and merchants. Craftsmen made and sold important supplies like jewelry, pottery, papyrus, products, tools, etc.  These items needed to be seld from the artisans and traders, so merchants sold these goods to the public.

7d881c44e9e7,39c16e,"According to Aristotle, the first element of an ideal tragedy is that it should have a complex storyline that evokes emotion in the audience. In paragraph 2, he states, ""...imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man...""  Here he states that the tragedy should show complex characters with a complex storyline so the audience can feel different emotions that should be felt in a tragedy, such as pity and fear. The second element of a tragedy is that the plot should contain a man neither good nor evil whose life falls apart from a mistake. A character should not move from pure happiness to pure misfortune, or vise versa. For example, in paragraph 2, Aristotle states, ""...here remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous..."" Throughout the paragraph Aristotle shows that a character should fall in between good and evil, which in turn can evoke more emotion in the audience rather than merely being shocked. The third element of a tragedy is that the complex storyline and plot should have the character's fortune go from good to bad, because of a greater mistake created. Aristotle continues to mention this throughout paragraph 3 as the ending should always be in misfortune or unhappiness.

9684321147d5,ebad26,"In the article, Excerpt From The Jungle, there were many ways factories tried to cover up spoiled meat. Throughout this article it tells us that no matter the color, flavor, or smell they would still sell the meat. These factories didn't care for the health of their consumers and only wanted to make money, so they sold every piece of meat that they could. While reading this article it sounds like they would never let a single piece of meat go to waste even if it was spoiled and covered in mold. In the article it states, “old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white – it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.”(3). This quote from the article explains to us how they covered up the molded meat by using strong and toxic chemicals to get rid of the smell and turn the meat back to brown. The factories had no health regulations, the meat was stored in places infested with germs. The factories knew how filthy their facility was and had put no effort in  to change it. In paragraph 4 it states, “There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs.”(4). This tells us how nobody cared about the condition the meat was in and how no one enforced them to follow any guidelines that had been put in place. Workers knew that what they were doing was wrong and never second guessed it, “a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats. These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together.”(4). This quote from the article tells the reader how they used rat meat for sausages. These rats contained many diseases and carried poison from eating contaminated  bread. Which they thought was right to feed  humans. In the factories, spoiled meat was covered up badly. Instead of throwing away the rotting meat they found ways to use it to seem consumable to humanity while they were making it much worse.",3.20924836058688,2.55011210796677,Summarize the various ways the factory would use or cover up spoiled meat.

Jones emphasized to his students that following this new regime would make them stronger people, encouraging them to take part in it. Additionally, he required them to salute each other outside of his watch, which they did because they felt a motive to do so. After a short while, since just 30 people decided to take part, over 100 more students joined in to be apart of what seemed ""superior"".  Jones eventually had to end the experiment to show the students how they had began to justify their actions towards other students in the name of the Third Wave. Overall, the entire point of the experiment was to make the students realize how quickly individuals strive to be superior over others and follow a crowd so, to get them to realize this, Jones had to end the experiment.

Pity and fear can be drawn out of a viewer or reader when the characters do something to bring unfortunate circumstances upon themselves. For example, Romeo and Juliet create a situation in which they both end up killing themselves over the death of the other. In Greek tragedies, the characters must live with their mistakes and suffer, while in Shakespearian tragedies, the characters die. These two are similar because each person has misfortune brought upon them by their own misjudgment. This ties directly to how the character's situation turns from good to bad, rather than from bad to good.

Evoking pity and fear from an audience are staples to a basic tragedy because such strong emotions practically entice the audience into the story; the audience may be able to see themselves in the story presented. The downfall of the story's villain in a tragedy should not be included because such event would only satisfy the audience and their moral sense. Pity and fear would not come from a villain's downfall because the evil had been defeated for the sake of what is ""good"" in the story. The main character of a tragedy should be balanced because their grey morality in views has the audience wonder if theiractions were deserving of such misfortune.

This will be effective in creating feelings of pity and fear for the reader which are two important moods that should result from a tragedy. Another element of an ideal tragedy that Aristotle described is that the tragic hero should be someone well-known and successful. Aristotle uses the examples of Oedipus and Thyestes because both are of royal descent, helping to once again get across the feeling of fear by showing the reader that someone so fortunate may not always be so lucky. Finally, a feature that Aristotle mentioned that should be included in order to create an ideal tragedy would be that the character’s fortune should go from good to bad as opposed to it going from bad to good. This reverse in fortune would create a feeling of pity for the character as the reader would feel sorry for them as they face their downfall.

3613c50796bc,39c16e,"Aristotle states that the most important element of an ideal tragedy is that it should excite pity and fear in the audience. He states, ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation""(7-9).  This element really helps to draw in the audience and make them feel the right emotions for the characters. Another element that Aristotle believes to be valid for a tragedy is that the main character should be a normal person, not terribly good nor evil. He describes this as, ""That of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity""(22-23). Having a more normal character makes it easier for the audience to relate to them as well as to feel for them and understand what they are going through. The last element that Aristotle describes is that of a well-constructed plot. He writes, ""The change of fortune should not be from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad""(27).  Structuring the plot in this way truly enforces the feeling and effects of a tragedy. These are just three small elements that the great philosopher, Aristotle, believed to be important in a perfect tragedy.",2.51454508494933,2.84414375349913,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

a4f95b61b691,39c16e,    The first of three elements of an ideal tragedy follow the type of character used.  Aristotle believes that the character of a tragedy should not be a villain and nor should it be a hero as this creates fundamental flaws within the emotions of the reader which brings me to the second element of an ideal tragedy.  The second element of an ideal tragedy is that the emotions and experiences had by the character must appear relatable to the reader as these are the precise emotions that a tragedy aims to make the reader feel.  By allowing the reader to actually feel tragedy they are left with the emotions of a tragic conclusion which brings me to the final aspect of an ideal tragedy.  The final element of a proper tragedy is that the conclusion must remain tragic; meaning that the character must not see his conditions reverse.  By allowing the character to remain in tragedy even through the end of the story the author allows the reader to bask in the emotions that are ever-present in a successful tragedy.,2.19286538414915,2.97504546224614,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,"Chapter 13

It was believed that Gods and Goddesses like Ra, Osiris, and Isis controlled the universe at their whim. Pharaohs were believed to be living Gods in human form and given great power and responsibility. Assisting the Pharaoh was the vizier, or tax collector who used scribes, or high-level, literate record keepers. Below the Pharaohs were Nobles and Priests. Nobles held government posts and profited off of tributes to the Pharaoh while Priests held responsibility to please the Gods. One tier lower are Soldiers and Skilled Workers, or Artisans. Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings, also supervising slaves, peasants, and farmers in peacetime. Artisans such as physicians and craftsmen were middle-class people, Craftsmen making and selling jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things. To stimulate the economy, there were merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public. At the bottom of the proverbial barrel are Slaves and Farmers. Slaves were captured Prisoners of War, forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the whim of the pharaoh and nobles. Farmers tended fields, raised animals, kept waterways in good order, worked in the quarries, and built royal monuments. Farmers paid as much as 60% of their yearly harvest as tax.

He wanted to show the students first hand how this movement worked. He announced that he was starting a movement to eliminate democracy, and he started to get his students involved immediately. Jones instilled extensive rules and proper disciplinary skills into his students by the end of the first day. The movement picked up steam, and by the third day, the movement expended to over 40 students. They even had a salute resembling that of the Nazi regime. Everyone obeyed Jones. However, by the fourth day, more than 200 students joined in on the bandwagon, and the experiment was getting out of control. Therefore, Jones decided to end it by tricking his students into thinking that the Third Wave was a nationwide movement and that a Presidential Candidate would officially confirm its existence. in the end, that definitely did not happen.
