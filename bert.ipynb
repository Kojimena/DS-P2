He must be relatable to let the audience create their own image of him. Second, the main character must have a downfall based on a human error made within the play. Third, it should have one true plot, never straying from the main story. It has been proven that having more than one plot tends to lead toward a more comedy-like story than a true tragedy.',\n",

They wouldn\\'t remove rats or anything that fell in so they would just label the meat \"special\" and charge it 2 cents per pound more.

Upton Sinclair states, \"To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor- a process known to the workers as \"giving them thirty per cent.\" Then, if the meat looked moldy they had a different process. The article states, \"There would come all the way back from Europe old sausage that has been rejected, and that was moldy and white- it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.\" This shows how the workers didnt care how old the meat was and where it came from, but instead how much they could make and money.

It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation.\"   And a story shouldn\\'t end on a good note but rather a bad one, the characters in story suffering or have done something terrible, \"The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse.\" The last is the second, rank, tragedy, which something something tragic happen but goes more on the side of comedy, \"The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure.

       " '    The structure of the ancient Egyptian system of government revealed many ways the social classes were involed in the government/the pyramids. At the high class of the government were pharohs, vizers and scribes. The texts says, \"No single person could manage all these duties without assistance. The pharaoh appointed a chief minister called a vizier7 as a supervisor. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected. Working with the vizier were scribes who kept government records. These high-level employees had mastered a rare skill in ancient Egypt — they could read and write.\" The people in source of government were noble and priest. The text supports this when it say, \"Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes8 paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods.\" Around themiddle class section were physicians and craftsmen with women. The texts supports my claim because, it states, \"Skilled workers such as physicians and craftsmen/women made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus11 products, tools, and other useful things.\" Finally, at the bottom of the heap were slaves and farmers. In the 3rd to the last paragraph it state, \"At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers. Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles.\"',\n",

A plot of this kind would, doubtless, satisfy the moral sense, but it would inspire neither pity nor fear...\" Aristotle also wrote, \"The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but reversely, from good to bad.\" Aristotle wanted the poet to show this to shock the reader and keep them intrigued.',\n",

Also this experiment made students believe they were apart of something important . Members began to discriminate against the students that had not joined. Members also began reporting to Mr. Jones if they thought another member was going aganist the rules, and the members assaigned themselves jobs that would help further the movement. Overall the experiment was ended because it got out of hand and Mr. Jones believed that the student's didipline and loyalty to the project was so outstanding that it was slipping out of control.\",\n",

The fact that the workers would use their feet in the process indicated how the meatpacking industry was corrupt when it came to providing sanitary ham\\'s to the population and that it would find any way possible to increase productivity and cover-up spoiled meat. In Excerpt From The Jungle by Upton Sinclair, light is shed on the corrupt practices of the meat industry as they would taken the bones out of rotten ham and pickle ham to reduce the odor in attempts to cover it up from the rest of the population.',\n",

The main character can\\'t be a \"bad man passing from adversity to prosperity\" (Paragraph 2) but also can\\'t be \"a man who is not eminently good and just\" (Paragraph 2). The main character has to be neutral, neither good nor evil. At the same time, a tragedy has to induce pity and fear. A tragedy can\\'t have \"the downfall of the utter villain be exhibited\" (Paragraph 2) because that wouldn\\'t bring fear or pity, but we rejoice instead. For a ideal tragedy, pity should be \"aroused by unmerited misfortune\" (Paragraph 2) and fear by \"the misfortune of a man like ourselves\" (Paragraph 2). The final element is that the main characters fortune \"should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad\" (Paragraph 3) and should be caused \"by some error of judgement or frailty\" (Paragraph 2). A neutral character, a story that evokes pity and fear, and have good fortune go to bad fortune because of the main character\\'s judgement are the elements that make an ideal tragedy.',\n",

Aristotle also says a good tragedy should portray a character who is somewhere in the middle between being inherently good and inherently bad. He says \"There remains, then, the character between these two extremes - that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.\" Essentially, Aristotle is saying that the main character shouldn\\'t be too good, as this wouldn\\'t invoke any pity, however, the character also shouldn\\'t be too evil, or else the audience wouldn\\'t feel sorry for him and his bad misfortune. Lastly, Aristotle says a good tragedy should exhibit a character experiencing misfortune due to a flaw in his character, not necessarily because of bad or immoral behaviror. He says \"It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse.\" Overall, Aristotle argues that a good tragedy should portray a character who is neither good nor bad, but rather somewhere in the middle, who experiences a change of fortune from good to bad due to some inherent flaw of his character.

Egyptian merchants carried products such as gold, papyrus made into writing paper or twisted into rope, linen cloth, and jewelry to other countries. Next after merchants were artisans. Artisans created the fine artwork that often covered temples, royal tombs, and other monuments. They worked in large groups to complete engravings, paintings, and hieroglyphics.

The male servants also worked on royal building projects or were sent to fight in the Egyptian army. Egyptian servants did not have many rights but were usually not treated poorly.

And yet, in spite of this, there would be hams found spoiled...\" This evidence further describes how they would mask spoiled meat. Finally, once the factory discovered how to take the bone out of a ham, they would insert a white-hot iron, and they would go on to sell \"boneless hams\" or \"California hams\" and fancy \"skinned hams\" which all were filled with spoiled meat. However no one would buy skinned hams, until they were cooked, and chopped up fine, which they then called \"head cheese\". Evidence comes from paragraph two, \"...but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron. The packers were always originating such schemes—they had what they called “boneless hams,” which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and “California hams,” which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out; and fancy “skinned hams,” which were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no one would buy them—that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled “head cheese!” These lines of text explain the procedure that happened to the hams just for them to be sold.

       " '    The ideal tragedy should include a multi-dimensional conflict, a neutral character\\'s mistake, and that character\\'s fortune turning from good to bad. A conflict that only has one tragic trait is not a tragedy, since it will not have enough dimension to provoke the emotions within an audience that are associated with tragedy, since this kind of conflict \"never satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear\" due to its basic nature (\"On Tragedy\"). Therefore, the writer(s)  should include multiple traits that build up to form the many different pillars that make a tragedy, since tragedies rarely occur because of a single tragic trait. To follow this conflict outline, the main character in a tragedy should be neither good nor bad, and their misfortune should occur due to a mistake that they\\'ve made. This is because \"pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves,\" meaning that it will be easier for the audience to feel pity and empathize with a character if they can see themselves in that character\\'s shoes (\"On Tragedy\"). The character\\'s fortune should also change from good to bad, since this will reflect the same pity in the audience that was aforementioned. When it comes down to why the target feeling is pity, that\\'s because pity is the leading feeling that audiences have when reacting to tragedies. After all, tragedies are defined as \"great suffering, destruction, and distress,\" and these types of situations always have emotional consequences (Oxford Dictionary). If a tragedy is unsuccessful in provoking the emotions that come with tragedy, then it clearly would not be the ideal tragedy. ',\n",

First, Aristotle explains that \"a perfect tragedy should be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan\". (Aristotle 2). Aristotle continues by suggesting that the tragedy should \"imitate actions which excite pity and fear\" and calls this the \"distinctive mark of tragic imitation\" (Aristotle 2). This desire for readers to feel pitiful and fearful leads to Aristotle\\'s second element of an ideal tragedy; for it to be emotional. Aristotle claims that an emotional piece \"is proper rather to Comedy,\" suggesting that all tragedies should end with the reader feeling sorrow. (Aristotle 4). Lastly, the author states that the ideal tragedy \"should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad\" (Aristotle 3). Aristotle believes that the ideal tragedy should include \"that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgment or frailty\" (Aristotle 3).',\n",

Another element of an ideal tragedy would be imitate which is copy or simulate. Which would be the tradgec or fearsome things happening again and again. The last element of an Ideal tragedy would be plainly which is in a style that is not elaborate or luxurious. ',\n",
       " '3 elements of an ideal tragedy are  developing the evolving of a main character or characters and how the tragedy is phrased,  for example the words used and how those words contribute to the story, and a good plot.

He had also thought the added emotions made his plays that much more successful. Falling into the previous statement, that is why he had enjoyed unhappy endings.

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
